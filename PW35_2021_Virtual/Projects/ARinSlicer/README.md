## Key Investigators

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Augmented Reality has increase its adoption in many areas with exciting benefits. Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Madrid, Spain) has already worked in several medical projects
based on AR (see their progress in https://biig-igt.uc3m.es/augmented-reality/). On these studies, they usually export information from Slicer to an alternative software (Unity). 

The ultimate goal of this project is to check if it is possible to incorporate this technology directly to 3D Slicer in order to centralize the working process, at the time 
of benefiting from all Slicer tools.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Learn what can be done in AR using 3D Slicer
2. Explore possible paths to integrate AR in 3D Slicer in the future

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Integration of OpenXR (or whatever framework) in SlicerVR, so that we can merge AR + VR.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
