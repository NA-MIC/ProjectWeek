# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Labelling data for training deep neural networks is a tedious and time-consuming task, especially for segmentation problems. Many of the existing tools
available within Slicer are optimized for working with static 3D volumes such as MRI and CT. Annotation of video-based sequences such as ultrasound and RGB video 
have unique challenges that are not seen when working with static volumes. The primary goal of this project is to assess the requirements of researchers working with 
time-series or video data to design a Slicer module that will be convenient to use for a wide variety of users. We will mostly focus on the task of creating segmentation 
labels, but are open to the discussion of annotation for classification and detection problems as well.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Establish the requirements, challenges and current workflow of researchers working with time-series or sequence data
2. Objective B. Design a module to be implemented in Slicer that will provide the most benefit and convenience for satisfying the requirements above
4. Objective C. If we have time we would like to begin the implementation of the module

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  We would like to have discussions with as many people who work with video and time-series data to assess their requirements 
   and their current workflow for labelling data, along with any specific challenges relating to using currently available tools.
2. Compile a list of features that would be most useful and convenient to satisfy the requirements from objective A.
3. If there is time we will begin to design a user-interface for the module and potentially begin some preliminary implementation.

## Progress and Next Steps
