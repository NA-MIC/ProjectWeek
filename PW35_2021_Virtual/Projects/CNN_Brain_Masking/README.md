# Project Description

Develop a deep learning based Brain Masking Module with improved performance and accuracy over current alternatives.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Test accuracy and reliability of a Deep Learning based Brain Masking Solution
1. Objective B. Integrate the solution into 3D slicer
1. Objective C. Test and improve performance of the integrated solution

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Explore Image Registration options (EasyReg/MERMAID)
1. Research current Deep Learning based Brain Masking (HD-BET, Auto Net)
1. Get access to data for training and testing
1. Create the solution
1. Figure out how to integrate the solution
1. Evaluate the performance

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Applied for NIH Dataset Request
1. Tested HD-BET Segmentation
1. Extracted PyTorch parameter(s) from HD-BET
1. Begin building Slicer Module with HD-BET parameters
