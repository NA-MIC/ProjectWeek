# Overview of DICOM and the open source ecosystem


---

# Why use DICOM?
* Universal standard for medical imaging
* Don't lose data
  * Get all the details from the scanner
  * Well-defined representations with documentation

---

# How to think about DICOM
* Each "dataset" is an instance of a "class" with strongly typed instance variables (called "elements")
    * Instances can be stored as files (called Part-10 files after the section of the standard describing them)
    * Instances can be grouped when they share unique IDs
* The sequence of instances are like a logfile of what the scanner generated and it's up to the application to sort through them to determine the relationships and map them into useful constructs like Volumes, Segmentations, etc.
* To create DICOM instances the application populates the elements to link it with the other instances as appropriate

# Some of the more useful DICOM classes
* Imaging: CT, MR, PET, US...
    * Orginal scan data
* Segmentation: SEG
    * Image based labeling of structures
* Structured Reporting: SR
    * Vector annotations, quantifications, qualitative findings
* Radiotherapy: RT
    * Doses, plans, structures...
* Parametric Maps: PM
    * Images with defined quantities and units
* Spatial Registration: SRO
    * Linear and nonlinear with explicit frames of reference
* Whole Slide Images: WSI
    * Microscopy images, possibly multichannel with annotations in SR

# DICOM networking
* DIMSE is tradional "PACS" networking used worldwide
  * Both endpoints need custom configuration
  * Best for use within controlled firewalls
* DICOMweb is uses modern REST API concepts
  * Better suited to internet and security
  * Introduced JSON header encoding

---

# DICOM Implementations: Java, C#
* PixelMed toolkit, open source, but intended for reference not for community use
* FairOaks
* probably others...

---

# DICOM Implementations: C++
* GDCM: traditional implementation used in ITK
* DCMTK: also widely used in ITK and many other places
* CommonTK (CTK)
    * DCMTK + Qt * SQLite
    * Core of Slicer's DICOM module
* dcmqi: convenience interface over DCMTK to support encoding of analysis results in DICOM

---

# DICOM Implementations: Python
* pydicom
    * Widely used, bundled with Slicer
    * Maps instances to python objects and numpy arrays
* pydicomnet
    * Implements DIMSE with pydicom
* dicomweb-client
    * Implements DICOMweb with pydicom
* highdicom (new)
    * Adds SEG, SR, etc on pydicom
---

# DICOM Implementations: JavaScript
* dicomParser, cornerstone, OHIF
    * Layers of the Open Health Imaging Foundation stack
* dcmjs.org
    * dcmjs: maps instances to/from JavaScript classes
        * original: emscripten cross-compiled DCMTK
        * current: pure JavaScript (browser/server)
    * dicomweb-client/dicomweb-server: DICOMweb on dcmjs
    * dcmjs-dimse (new): DIMSE on dcmjs (server only)
* Can be used in qSlicerWebWidget

---

# DICOM in Slicer
* DICOM module supports local database and DIMSE networking
* DICOM Plugins examine related instances to propose mappings to Slicer datatypes, export Sicer data to DICOM
* DICOMwebBrowser query/retrieve/store and support Google DICOMweb stores securely
* DICOM Plugins provided by SlicerRT, QuantitativeReporting, PET...

---

# Summary
* Supporting all of DICOM is a huge task
* Community is very active tools are becoming very capable
* Interoperability is improving
    * Slicer-generated segmentations in OHIF
    * OHIF structured report annotations in Slicer
    * highdicom encoded machine learning results in Slicer and OHIF
