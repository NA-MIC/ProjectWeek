# Project Description

We built a data-glove that tracks hand movements. Our goal is to connect it to Slicer with OpenIGTLink or with the Plus toolkit. The glove has a simple IMU (with 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer /MPU9250/) and a processing unit (Arduino Uno).


## Objective

1. Stable connections between the glove and the Slicer

## Approach and Plan

1. Making connection between the glove and Slicer with Plus toolkit
1. Plans for the future

## Progress and Next Steps

1. The glove can be used as an orientation sensor.
1. For virtual operations we need a different approach and decvice. (For example Leap Motion)
