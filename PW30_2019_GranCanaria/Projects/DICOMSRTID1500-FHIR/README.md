# Project Description

Our goal is to investigate and understand (the possibility of?) lossless, automatic,
"roundtrip" conversion between DICOM Structured Reporting and FHIR representations
for communicating imaging-derived measurements.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Understand and discuss capabilities of the two representations.
2. Understand possibility, limitations, support in tools for lossless interoperability
between DICOM SR TID1500 instances and FHIR documents.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Put together pointers to relevant documentation, samples, tutorials to help get started
a novice in the topic.
2. Define specific examples of varying complexity.
3. Create hand-coded or automatically generated representations of the same content
using the two approaches.

Should we also consider [TID2000 Basic Diagnostic Imaging Report](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_A.html#sect_TID_2000)?

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Investigated, discussed, learned a lot, concluded that roundtrip
   conversion is not a good goal: DICOM should stay the primary
   storage of all details, FHIR should serve only as a medium for
   storing the most important results (with references to the
   underlying DICOM objects), in order to make them available together
   with other EHR data!
1. Put up code at [https://github.com/hmeine/tid1500-fhir](https://github.com/hmeine/tid1500-fhir)
1. Prepared Typescript-based expected FHIR results (autocompletion!) + conversion scripts to JSON
1. Created a script that uses dsr2xml (from dcmtk), parses the resulting XML, and creates FHIR resources
1. Created a second script uploads the result to a FHIR server (first checking for existing duplicates)
