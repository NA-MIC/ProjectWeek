# Project Description

Sometimes unknown file formats are encountered that contain images. There are free tools to handle these (eg. try to guess the bit depth, X and Y resolution, etc) but it is currently not possible from within Slicer.

## Objective

1. Set basic image read parameters (bytes to skip (header), bitness, etc)
2. Display the loaded image in 3D view

## Approach and Plan

1. Add some more functionality.
2. Add ideas so they can be implemented later.

## Progress

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->
All basic image parameters can be set:
- header to skip
- endianness
- X, Y and Z dimensions
- image bit depth/pixel type

## Next Steps:
- set automaic thresholding
- automatically update the image in the viewer
- display it in the 3D viewer
- calculate cross-correlation between lines of image to make the guessing easier

# Illustrations

<!--Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.-->
