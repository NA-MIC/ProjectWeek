# Segment Editor clinical workflows

## Key Investigators

- [Andras Lasso](http://perk.cs.queensu.ca/users/lasso) (Queen's University, Canada)
- [Scheherazade Kraß](http://www.mic.uni-bremen.de/cmt-management-team/scheherazade-kras/) (University of Bremen, Germany)
- Anybody with questions and suggestions for image segmentation

# Project Description

## Objective

* Segment Editor is the new manual and semi-automated image segmentation module in Slicer. It has powerful tools, but the learning curve can be steep for segmenting more complex cases.
* The objective is to help researchers aiming to use Segment Edtitor use it for their specific use cases, and augment the training material based on the results

## Approach and Plan

* Each participating researcher brings a dataset, for which we'll attempt to develop an effective segmentation workflow
* Add the developed workflows in the [Slicer Segmentation Recipes](https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerSegmentationRecipes) page
  * Publicly share dataset
  * Create a tutorial page for the segmentation case including screenshots

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->

* Liver Data-set: Segmentation of lesion and vessels (as prerequesite for robotic intervention support)
