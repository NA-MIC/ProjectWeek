# Lightweight DICOMweb Server with CouchDB 

## Key Investigators

- Emel Alkim (Stanford)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics)

# Project Description

This project aims to work on a prototype lightweight DICOM server that will support DICOMweb standard and host the DICOM files as JSON objects. It will leverage previous work on SlicerChronicle and dcmjs. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Provide prototype of a lightweight DICOM server that supports DICOMweb queries
2. Provide an example implementation of a proxy layer to transfer DICOMweb queries to CouchDB

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Implement an example translation of a DICOMweb query to CouchDB map/reduce statements
2. Implement translation of the CouchDB response to DICOMweb response
3. Build a bridge between SlicerChronicle and dcmjs to host the DICOM files as JSON files and support CSTORE

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. SlicerChronicle stores DICOM object instances as documents in CouchDB
2. ...
3. ...
