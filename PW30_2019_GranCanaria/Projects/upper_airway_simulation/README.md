# Project Description

We want to do some airflow simulations in a finite element software but we didn't managed to import the 3D upper airway models which we made in the Slicer. 
 
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Smooth the 3D models
2. Import the models succesfully to the finite element software and mesh them
3. Do some airflow simulations

## Approach and Plan
