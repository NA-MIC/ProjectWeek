## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What?

The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, [3D Slicer](http://www.slicer.org), and [VTK](http://www.vtk.org), [ITK](http://www.itk.org), [CMake](http://www.cmake.org), and [CDash](http://www.cdash.org) libraries as well as [OHIF](http://ohif.org), [Cornerstone](https://cornerstonejs.org/), [dcmjs](https://github.com/dcmjs-org), [vtkjs](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/), [itkjs](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/itk-js/), [DICOMweb](https://www.dicomstandard.org/dicomweb/), [Girder](https://girder.readthedocs.io/) and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie on the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Project Week is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.

#### When, where, how much?

The Project Week events are held twice a year, January in Europe, and June in North America, with ad-hoc meetings added occasionally. The registration fee for in-person events is approximately 500 (USD or Euro), and is used to cover breakfast, lunch, and coffee.

#### How does it work?

Weekly videoconferences for preparation begin 8 weeks before an event. Potential participants propose projects during these meetings, and collaboratively create a list of projects that are of mutual interest. The projects include platform work, algorithm development, and biomedical applications. Through the course of the meetings, each participant selects one or more project teams and develops goals for the week. The first day of the Project Week itself begins with a 2-hour  introduction to all projects and participants. The rest of the week consists of a mix of working sessions and breakout sessions on special topics, as decided by the participants during the preparatory meetings. The event concludes on the last (5th day) with a 2-hour progress report for all projects.

#### Who can attend?

Project Weeks are open to all and publicly advertised. Email announcements are sent to the [Project Week mailing list](https://public.kitware.com/mailman/listinfo/na-mic-project-week) (for continuity) and posted on the [Project Week forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/project-week). One-day participation is permitted for first-time attendees, but rest stay for the entire event.

#### Who should attend?

Please attend a preparatory videoconference to determine if your project has resonance with the other participants who are planning to attend that particular event (see each Project Week page for details).

#### What else?

The Project Week series was founded in 2005, along with the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NAMIC), which was chartered by the NIH to build a computational infrastructure for biomedical research. Today, Project Week has become one of the major events in the calendars of several NIH-funded Center efforts where they convene and collaborate. Participants in Project Week include [NAC](http://nac.spl.harvard.edu/), [NCIGT](http://www.ncigt.org/), [QIICR](http://qiicr.org/), and [CANARIE](https://www.canarie.ca/). Additional details about our experience in running these events since 2005 are available here: [Increasing the Impact of Medical Image Computing Using Community-Based Open-Access Hackathons: the NA-MIC and 3D Slicer Experience](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841516301128).
