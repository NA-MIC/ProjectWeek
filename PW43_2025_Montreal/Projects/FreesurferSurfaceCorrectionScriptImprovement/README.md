# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The project consists in improving freesurfer generated white and pial surfaces, by adding manual segmentation information.
Some outputs from recon-all still need to be generated by the script.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Check which outputs still need to be generated before upgrading the script
2. Check visualy those outputs




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Jarrett Rushmore, neuro-anatomist, will evaluate the outputs generated by the script.
2. He will also give tips on how to make easier for him and his colleagues to use the script.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Added dilation and erosion control arguments to solve Hippocampus-Amygdala VS cortex labeling
2. Added RS to script specific files to distinguish with files compatible with recon-all
3. Checked the script outputs visually
