# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The SlicerSOFA project has already been integrated as a Slicer extension, providing core functionality including python bindings and many examples.
We'd now like to take the next steps to determine default funcationality and determine how we want to enable applications that use the extension. In addition we will tackle some of the issues that need a fix, most notably, the MacOS extension packaging which to date is not available.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Define what SOFA plugins should be enabled for the extension and update the packaged SOFA to the lastest possible version (SOFA is currently in v25.06, while SlicerSOFA still uses v24.06).

2. Objective B. See if we can build a template for SlicerSOFA-based extensions that can provide custom C++ SOFA plugins.
This would allow the SOFA community to leverage Slicer's existing infrastructure for cross-platform testing and distribution.

3. Objective C. Discuss/prototype parallel processing architectures to optimize overlap of simulation and rendering for best interactive performance.
 
4. Objective D. Bug fixing ([#44](https://github.com/slicer/slicersofa/issues/44)) and MacOS package fixing

5. Objective E. Discuss other topics of interest to potential SlicerSOFA users.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Meet to review existing SlicerSOFA build configuration and options.

2. Discuss and possibly prototype a C++ SOFA plugin in a SuperBuild extension that depends on SlicerSOFA

3. Discuss various client/server and message passing options, such as an http-based protocol, RPyC, or others.
   
4. Improve the SlicerSOFA (and possibly SOFA) CMake infrastructure to enable MacOS packaging. Review SlicerSOFA python infrastructure in connection with the SoftTissueSimulation and [#44](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerSOFA/issues/44) 

6. Reach out to other Project Week attendess who express interest.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
### Progress of the MacOS pacakaging for SlicerSOFA
There is new infrastructure in Slicer to enable the MacOS package of SlicerSOFA. The changes have been largely merged and still need to be tested. 
  - One PR has been opened on SOFA to globally specify OUTPUT_DIRECTORY for runtime, archive and library material [sofa-framework/sofa#5558](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/5558).
  - One PR has been opened on SOFA to globally specify the RELOCATION path for plugins, applications and projects [sofa-framework/sofa#5562](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/5562).
  - One PR has been opened on Slicer for adding CMake infrastructure supporting `rpath` manipulation on third-party libraries for MacOS [Slicer/Slicer#8516](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8516).
  - One commited change (fix) to align SOFA with the Slicer infrastructure [Slicer/SOFA-f698e29](https://github.com/Slicer/sofa/commit/f698e29e66e24c702e665c9fb80822731dd31407). 
  - One PR has been merged on SlicerSOFA for fixing the MacOS package [Slicer/SlicerSOFA#48](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerSOFA/pull/48)./
  - The implications of these changes go beyond SlicerSOFA, as they establish a good base for Superbuild extensions packaging complex third-party libraries to be successfully packaged as Slicer extensions.

### Use of RpyC
  - We have successfully prototyped an example for the use of RpyC for remote procedure calls to a remote SOFA server.
  - We have discussed about the correct form of leveraging a SlicerSOFA based on RpyC without a final conclusion.

### Review of current SlicerSOFA build options
  - Our colleagues from the SOFA framework have been working on new adaptations of the SOFA CMake infrastructure to make SOFA more modular on its inclusion in other projects
  - After the fix of MacOS packaging, there will be a review of options for improving the way SOFA is built and deployed in SlicersOFA

### SlicerSOFA documentation
  - Feedback from the Slicer community suggested an urgent need for establishing a documentaion of the SlicerSOFA project.
  - During ProjectWeek43, we have established the infrastructure for a readthedocs documentation of the project and initial content has been added
