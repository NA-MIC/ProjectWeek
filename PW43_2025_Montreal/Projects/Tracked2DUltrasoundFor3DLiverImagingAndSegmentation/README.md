# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We want to image the liver using 2D ultrasound tracked with Optotrak and generate 3D ultrasound from the sweep. We then want to segment the 2D slices and the 3D volume to reconstruct the liver.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Describe **what you plan to achieve** in 1-2 sentences.
We aim to generate a 3D ultrasound volume of the liver by performing a freehand sweep of 2D ultrasound images tracked using the Optotrak system. The final result will include both 2D slice-level and 3D volume-level liver segmentations to enable accurate liver reconstruction.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
