# Improve Slicer build instructions
Building a custom version of slicer has become increasingly difficult.  
    - Identify how to install Qt on an arm based apple M4 computer.
    - Identify how to install Qt on Ubuntu 24.04 linux computer.


# Investigate the status of moving to Qt6 
Provide support/testing environments for migration to Qt6.

# Investigate updating TCLAP to build cleanly, perhaps update to latest version of TCLAP.

# Motivation
I'd like to prepare Slicer for future versions of ITK, but configuring a stable build environiment has been more challenging that expected (primarily regarding Qt 5 requirements).
