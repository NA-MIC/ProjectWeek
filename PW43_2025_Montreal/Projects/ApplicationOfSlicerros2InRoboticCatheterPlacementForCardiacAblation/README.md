# Project Description

We investigate the use of SlicerROS2 to simulate robotic catheter in the heart anatomy for cardiac ablation. 



## Objective
1. We will develop a tool to configure robotic catheter and generate URDF data, 
2. Test the URDF for visualization in RViz/3D Slicer and dynamic simulation in the Gazebo simulator.

## Approach and Plan
1. Write a script to generate a URDF file to model the kinematic and visual models of the catheter.
2. Load the model onto the Gazebo dynamic simulator
3. Visualize the simulation outcome on 3D Slicer using SlicerROS2
4. (Optional) Create a 3D geometric model of the cardiovascular structures on 3D Slicer, and incorporate into the scene on the Gazebo simulator.
