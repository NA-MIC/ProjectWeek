# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


SlicerSOFA and SlicerROS are two paradigm extensions integrating Slicer with external libraries for simulation and robotics. With this project we would like to explore the possibility to use Slicer as a means for briding SOFA and ROS with the medical-image computing capabilities of Slicer for medical robotics applications.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Prototyping of a needle insertion example using SlicerSOFA with the Cosserat plugin and SlicerROS. This prototype will be used to test the feasibility of the integration and possible bottlenecks




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Integration of the SOFA Cosserat plugin in SlicerSOFA. 
2. Development of prototype application featuring deformation of models and propagation of deformation to medical images. The deformation will be driven by a Omni Phantom able to interact with a SOFA simulation



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
