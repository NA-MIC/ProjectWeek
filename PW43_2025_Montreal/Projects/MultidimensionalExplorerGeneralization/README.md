# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Several projects involve looking at clinical and imaging data for large collections, resulting in a multidimensional data space that can be difficult to quickly comprehend.

This project explores the use of eCharts with Slicer to make interactive visualizations of this kind of data.

Although we have some hand-coded examples for specific projects, it could be of interest to create a more generic tool using the Slicer dicomDatabase, tables, markups, and other data sources to generate visualizations.
