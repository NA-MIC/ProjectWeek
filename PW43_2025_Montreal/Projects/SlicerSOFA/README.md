# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The SlicerSOFA project has already been integrated as a Slicer extension, providing core functionality including python bindings and many examples.
We'd now like to take the next steps to determine default funcationality and determine how we want to enable applications that use the extension. In addition we will tackle some of the issues that need a fix, most notably, the MacOS extension packaging which to date is not available.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Define what SOFA plugins should be enabled for the extension and update the packaged SOFA to the lastest possible version (SOFA is currently in v25.06, while SlicerSOFA still uses v24.06).

2. Objective B. See if we can build a template for SlicerSOFA-based extensions that can provide custom C++ SOFA plugins.
This would allow the SOFA community to leverage Slicer's existing infrastructure for cross-platform testing and distribution.

3. Objective C. Discuss/prototype parallel processing architectures to optimize overlap of simulation and rendering for best interactive performance.

4. Objective D. Bug fixing ([#44](https://github.com/slicer/slicersofa/issues/44)) and MacOS package fixing

5. Objective E. Discuss other topics of interest to potential SlicerSOFA users.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Meet to review existing SlicerSOFA build configuration and options.

2. Discuss and possibly prototype a C++ SOFA plugin in a SuperBuild extension that depends on SlicerSOFA

3. Discuss various client/server and message passing options, such as an http-based protocol, RPyC, or others.

4. Improve the SlicerSOFA (and possibly SOFA) CMake infrastructure to enable MacOS packaging. Review SlicerSOFA python infrastructure in connection with the SoftTissueSimulation and [#44](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerSOFA/issues/44) 

6. Reach out to other Project Week attendess who express interest.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
### macOS Packaging for SlicerSOFA

Significant progress has been made toward enabling macOS packaging for SlicerSOFA. Most required infrastructure changes have been implemented and are pending final testing. The following contributions have been made:

* A PR was opened on SOFA to globally define `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` for runtime, archive, and library targets: [sofa-framework/sofa#5558](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/5558).
* Another PR was opened to globally set `RELOCATION` paths for plugins, applications, and projects: [sofa-framework/sofa#5562](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/5562).
* A PR was submitted to Slicer to introduce CMake infrastructure for `rpath` manipulation of third-party libraries on macOS: [Slicer/Slicer#8516](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8516).
* A committed fix aligned the SOFA fork used in Slicer with recent infrastructure improvements: [Slicer/sofa@f698e29](https://github.com/Slicer/sofa/commit/f698e29e66e24c702e665c9fb80822731dd31407).
* A PR has been merged in the SlicerSOFA repository to fix macOS packaging: [Slicer/SlicerSOFA#48](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerSOFA/pull/48).

> These updates not only benefit SlicerSOFA but also lay a solid foundation for packaging other SuperBuild-based extensions that rely on complex third-party libraries.

### RPyC Integration

* A working prototype was developed using [RPyC](https://rpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable remote procedure calls to a SOFA server. See proof-of-concept implementation here: [bakpaul/TestScenes](https://github.com/bakpaul/TestScenes) repository.
* Ongoing discussions have explored how SlicerSOFA could best leverage RPyC for distributed processing, but no final design decision has been made.

### Review of current SlicerSOFA build options

* The SOFA team has been actively refactoring their CMake infrastructure to improve modularity and facilitate integration into external projects like SlicerSOFA.
* Once macOS packaging support is finalized, we plan to review and refine how SOFA is built and deployed within SlicerSOFA, potentially simplifying the configuration process.

### SlicerSOFA documentation

* Community feedback has highlighted the urgent need for better documentation for SlicerSOFA.
* During Project Week 43, we created a [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) site for SlicerSOFA and began populating it with initial content to support onboarding and usage.
