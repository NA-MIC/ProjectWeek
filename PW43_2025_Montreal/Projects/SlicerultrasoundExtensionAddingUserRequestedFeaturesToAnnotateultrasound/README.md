# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


AnnotateUltrasound is a 3D Slicer extension designed to help users label and segment important features, such as B-lines and the pleura, in lung ultrasound scan videos. The module provides an interactive interface for annotating ultrasound frames with sector annotations,, managing multiple raters, and saving structured annotation data for research or clinical studies. It streamlines the process of reviewing ultrasound sequences, drawing lines to mark anatomical structures, and tracking annotation progress, making it easier to generate high-quality labeled datasets for machine learning or analysis.

We collaborate closely with several physicians who use AnnotateUltrasound in their clinical and research workflows. Their feedback directly shapes the moduleâ€™s features and usability, ensuring a user-centered design. We regularly incorporate their suggestions for new features and improvements based on their real-world experiences.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Frame-by-Frame Pleura Percentage Comparison: Display, for each rater, the frame with the highest pleura percentage directly in the rater table, and store this value in the annotation JSON, updating it automatically with any annotation changes.
2. Label Annotation Comparison: Add label annotation data to the rater table so users can compare both label and line annotations across raters in a single view.
3. Improved Line Endpoint Visualization: Reduce the size of line endpoints in the annotation interface to help users more precisely mark the edges of pleura and B-lines, minimizing annotation variability.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
