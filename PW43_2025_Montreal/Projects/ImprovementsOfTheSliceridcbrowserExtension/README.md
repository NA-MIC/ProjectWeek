# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

[SlicerIDCBrowser](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/SlicerIDCBrowser) is a 3D Slicer extension for exploring and downloading over 85TB of freely available image data from [NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore). This project is about updating and improving this extension to make it more usable and easier to maintain.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Plan refactoring of the extension
2. Improve features: add download progress reporting, simplify download by automatically detecting whether identifier specified by the user is collection/patient/study/series, support automatic loading of the images.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Discuss with Kyle overall organization of the extension, estimate effort.
2. Meet with the users to collect feedback.
3. Prioritize development and start working on implementation.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
