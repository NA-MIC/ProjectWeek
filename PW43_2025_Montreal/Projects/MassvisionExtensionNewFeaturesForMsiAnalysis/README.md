# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


MassVision is an extension in 3D Slicer for end-to-end AI-driven analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data. The current functionalities include data exploration via various targeted and non-targeted visualization, co-localization to spatial labels (histopathology annotations), dataset curation with spatial- and spectral-guidance, multi-slide dataset merge via feature alignment, denoising via spatial aggregation, AI model training and validation, and whole-slide AI deployment.
