# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


MassVision is an extension in 3D Slicer for end-to-end AI-driven analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data. The current functionalities include data exploration via various targeted and non-targeted visualization, co-localization to spatial labels (histopathology annotations), dataset curation with spatial- and spectral-guidance, multi-slide dataset merge via feature alignment, denoising via spatial aggregation, AI model training and validation, and whole-slide AI deployment.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Add new functionalities to the to the extension
2. Optimize the current code and UI
3. Update the documentation



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Add statistical analysis capabilities
    - Box/p-val
    - ANOVA
    - Vplcano
2. Add MixUp augmentation for dataset balancing
3. Add export data to imzML
4. Update volume naming for single-ion visualization
5. Update subplot arrangement for thumbnail views
6. Update the user manual for changes after revision



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. MassVision version 1.0 is up and running
