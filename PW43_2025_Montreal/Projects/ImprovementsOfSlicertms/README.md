# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The SlicerTMS project has been developed to predict the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation by using deep neural networks and magnetic resonance imaging data. In this project week, we further develop the software to improve the performance and integrate additional functions into this module.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Improve the overall software architecture for integration with other electric field solvers.
2. Objective B. Develop and test an example on the integration of the SimNIBS solver. 
3. Objective C. Validate and update the sampling algorithms in SlicerTMS and improve the file I/O strategy for vector nifti files.
4. Objective D. Discuss and improve the integration with neuronavigation and other fast segmentation and meshing techniques.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Meet to review existing SlicerTMS software structure and other external solvers (e.g., SimNIBS).
2. Discuss and prototype an improved architecture.
3. Compare the vtk-based resampling with SimNIBS to improve the accuracy of SlicerTMS models.
4. Talk with other teams about related toolboxes, e.g., OpenIGTLink, for improvement.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


TBD

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
