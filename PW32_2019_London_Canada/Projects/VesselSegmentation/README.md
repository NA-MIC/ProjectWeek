# Project Description
The idea is to use electromagnetic sensor on Conavi catheter, needle and guidewire to track them without
using fluoroscopy.


## Objective
1. Objective A. Segment vessel from US catheter.
1. Objective B. Build vessel model.

## Approach and Plan

1. Calibrate sensorized US catheter.
2. Take images and tracking data.
3. Segment vessels.
4. Build model.
