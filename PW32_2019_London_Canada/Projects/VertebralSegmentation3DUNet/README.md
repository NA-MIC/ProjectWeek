# Project Description
Use a previously trained 3D U-Net from Keras to segment vertebral bodies from CT scans.

## Objective
Place a pointer/fiducial marker on the scan with the mouse.
Pull out the coordinates of the marker in image-space.
Resample and crop the CT scan based on the marker's coordinates.
Send the cropped portion of the scan through the segmentation model.
