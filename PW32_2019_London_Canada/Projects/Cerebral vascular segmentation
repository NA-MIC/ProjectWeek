# Project Description

Cerebral vascular segmenation bids app powered by slicer. I plan to use modules like VMTKVesselEnhancment and thresholding to attempt to segment out cerebral along with an interface to provide interactive control for

## Objective

1. Convert raw dicom dataset to Bids.
2. Running converted data through T1/T2 preprocessing pipeline to do brain extraction and spatial normalization (probably going to borrow from fmri prep).
3. Creating slicer interface in nipype to use tools like VMTKVesselEnhancer and thresholding to add to current T1 and T2 preprocessing pipelines.
