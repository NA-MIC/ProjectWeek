# Project Description
<!-- I am working on the electromagnetic sensorization strategy for a Conavi probe. This is an Ultrasound catheter used for
intracardiac procedure. The idea is to use electromagnetic sensor on Conavi catheter, needle and guidewire to track them without
using fluoroscopy. The sensors I use (NDI Aurora) cannot be bent, otherwise the signal they give is affected by errors. I want to
verify if it is possible quantify this error and correct it--> 

## Objective
