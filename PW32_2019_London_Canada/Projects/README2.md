## Ultrasound Image based Tool-Tracking

## Key Investigators
- Hareem Nisar (Western University / Robarts Research Institute)

# Project Description
Scenario: Ultrasound Image-guided intracardiac interventions.  
Tool tracking: Track the position of the surgical tool using ultrasound images.
Passive marker design by J.Stoll 2012


## Objective
1. Use deep learning to solve a regression problem. 

## Approach and Plan

1. Generate dataset - tracked & calibrated ultrasound + passive markers 
2. Learn bit of regression in deep learning. ( I am newbie for DL)
3. Either use transfer learning or create a network from scratch

## Progress and Next Steps

To be filled..
