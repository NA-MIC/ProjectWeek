# Project Description
An ultrasound image-based tool tracking system using passive markers to provide image guidance during intracardiac interventions. 
We aim to design a passive marker design for surgical tools so that they appear uniquely on the ultrasound images. This unique marker configuration can be used to calculate the toolâ€™s pose. 
Using deep learning to estimate the pose of tool from the ultrasound images

## Objective

Generate a D.L network to estimate the tool's position based on images.

## Approach and Plan

1. Generate data set - tracked and calibrated ultrasound images + passive marker shaft
2. Learn about deep learning and regression in DL
3. Either transfer learning or new network design to solve the problem

## Progress and Next Steps

TBC
