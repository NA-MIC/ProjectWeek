# Project Description
An ultrasound image-based tool tracking system using passive markers to provide image guidance during intracardiac interventions.
We aim to design a passive marker design for surgical tools so that they appear uniquely on the ultrasound images. This unique marker configuration can be used to calculate the tool’s pose.
Using deep learning to estimate the pose of tool from the ultrasound images

## Objective

Generate a D.L network to estimate the tool's position based on images.

## Approach and Plan

1. Generate data set - tracked and calibrated ultrasound images + passive marker shaft
2. Learn about deep learning and regression in DL
3. Either transfer learning or new network design to solve the problem

## Progress and Next Steps

TBC
