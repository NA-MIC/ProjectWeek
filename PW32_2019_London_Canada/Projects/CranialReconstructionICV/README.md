## Intracranial volume calculation post-cranial reconstruction

## Key Investigators
- Jielin Lu

# Project Description
Post-cranial vault reconstruction, the skull often contains holes which makes existing automated processes of intracranial volume calculation not applicable.
Goal is to find a faster way of calculating intracranial volume without manually delineating each slice while maintaining sufficient accuracy. 

## Objective


## Approach and Plan


## Progress and Next Steps
- between thresholding to create skull model and shrinkwrap to generate skull volume model, could generate approximation of intracranial volume relatively quickly
- still requires visually inspecting model to crop out tubing, as well as delineating skull base as lower limit of axis
