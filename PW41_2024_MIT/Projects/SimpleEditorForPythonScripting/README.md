# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


A built-in simple text editor for python scripts has been discussed on the Slicer forum before. We would like to discuss design issues around this and hope to have a basic prototype (or two) by the end of PW. 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Support python syntax highlighting
2. Direct highlighted code from the editor to python console (e.g., right click interaction)
3. Embed scripts into the scene.
4. Code autocompletion.





## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.
No specific approach has been developed just yet.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

So far we have a brief web-based mock-up from Steve Pieper:

We also have a slicer module mock-up from Oshane Thomas:
