# Project Description

Combining multiple segmentations from skilled annotators can improve accuracy when creating ground truth image segmentations.
The Centaur annotation platform has new support for collecting and displaying annotations on DICOM studies using OHIF viewer.
We are currently in the middle of a 1-month task of sourcing and creating segmentations for radiology findings from hundreds
of annotators on 30,000 brain and abdominal CTs.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

We would like to extend an existing 2D clustering algorithm for combining multiple 2D segmentations to work
for 3D cuboid segmentations.

## Approach and Plan

1. Create 3D representation objects for cuboid annotations submitted through OHIF viewer
2. Implement clustering algorithm using a 3D instead of 2D distance metric

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
