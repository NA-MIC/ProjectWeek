# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We previously studied the application of a contrast-agnostic approach for MRI/CT abdomen organs segmentation, based on the generation of synthetic data. This synthetic data was then further used as a training set for a fully-supervised U-Net network.
Since this study was performed, other methods aiming to segment MR abdominal organs have been published. Our goal is to evaluate these new methods on IDC MR abdominal-focused data and see how it compares to our method.




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Evaluate performance of MR abdominal organs methods on IDC data.
2. Get feedback on our own method.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Select a subset of IDC MR abdominal-focused IDC data.
2. Create evaluation notebooks for newly published methods on this subset.
3. Compare to our method.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
