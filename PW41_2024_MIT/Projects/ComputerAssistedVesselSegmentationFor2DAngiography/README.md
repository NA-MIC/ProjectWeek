# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


I have written a C++ library for computer-assisted vessel segmentation in DSA images. I have a stand-alone application that demos this system. The application is also in C++ and uses Qt and OpenGL. I hope to provide this to the Slicer community as a Slicer module.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Get feedback from people at project week about whether they would find this useful.
2. Learn how to build a loadable C++ Slicer module.
3. Find out if Slicer can support the necessary OpenGL functionality. If not investigate what would be needed to support it.
4. Reach goal: build a loadable module with the bare-bones functionality of the system.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Demo the system to anyone who is interested.
2. Read the Slicer pages on building a loadable module. Seek help from experienced Slicer developers.
3. Talk to Slicer OpenGL gurus about OpenGL issues.
4. Stub out a loadable Slicer module and try to get it to run. Add OpenGL functionality for specialized rendering if possible.
