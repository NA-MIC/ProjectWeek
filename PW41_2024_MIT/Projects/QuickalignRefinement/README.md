# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


QuickAlign is a SlicerMorph module used to temporarily fix alignment in two 3D viewers. The user aligns the view in each viewer and then applies the linking. If the nodes are Markups, then joint editing of the point lists can be enabled. We plan to make usability improvements.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Address of issue object size/zoom
2. Assess implementations for transforming multiple nodes in scene
3. Discuss whether this may be a useful feature outside SlicerMorph




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Develop plan for correcting for object size/zoom
3. Discuss alternate implementations using camera transforms



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
