# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The project aims to empower non-English speaking end-users to realize the full potential of the platform by translating its user interface, tutorials and documentation to multiple languages.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Validation of manual translations
1. Objective B. Outreach to external Weblate contributors
1. Objective C. Identification of international Slicer community members interested in new Slicer activities in their languages
1. Objective D. Translation to French of SlicerIGT tutorials

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

### Slicer Internationalization sessions with members of the Slicer community
* Tuesday, June 25, 1:30-2:30 pm Slicer Internationalization Session
* Wednesday, June 26, 1:30-2:30 pm Slicer for Latin America Session
* Thursday, June 27, 1:30-2:30 pm Joint Slicer Internationalization Session and Slicer for Latin America Session

International PW41 participants, please complete the [3D Slicer Internationalization form](https://forms.gle/h7b92rDzbUzFqL7d9)  to participate in the sessions.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
