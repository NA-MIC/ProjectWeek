# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


[NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/) is a cloud-based environment containing publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with analysis and exploration tools and resources.

IDC provides a growing amount of publicly available cancer imaging data (>65TB at the moment, radiology and digital pathology, including images, annotations, analysis results and clinical data) curated in the cloud to support highly efficient access and to simplify analysis.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Interact with current and prospective users to answer questions and collect feedback.
2. Support any project that has a need for public datasets available for testing, cloud-based notebook implementations of the analysis, scaling up analysis to large cohorts within IDC.
3. Work on priority aspects of the project: maintenance and improvement of SlicerIDCBrowser and idc-index, improvements of the documentation and other learning materials
4. Improve/simplify access to the [NLST/TotalSegmentator analysis results](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/t/new-in-idc-v18-totalsegmentator-segmentations-and-radiomics-features-for-nlst-cts/582).
5. Work on maintenance of dcmqi priority issues: https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/issues/489, python wrapper API
6. MRTotalsegmenator SCT codes - Andras
7. DCMTK upgrade in Slicer - JC


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
