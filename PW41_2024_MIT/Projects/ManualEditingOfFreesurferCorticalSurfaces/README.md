# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We will continue to develop scripts to adapt freesurfer procedures so that manual corrections can be made accurately to white and pial surface reconstruction.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Improve code so it works better cross-platform 
2. Identify remaining areas where corrections are difficult to make and improve 
3. Use the modified surface in the downstream FreeSurfer pipelines
