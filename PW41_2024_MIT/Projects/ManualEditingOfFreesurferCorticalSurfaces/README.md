# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We will continue to develop scripts to adapt freesurfer procedures so that manual corrections can be made accurately to white and pial surface reconstruction.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Improve code so it works better cross-platform 
2. Identify remaining areas where corrections are difficult to make and improve 
3. Use the modified surface in the downstream FreeSurfer pipelines




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
1. Adapted the bash script for both Linux and MacOS
2. Identified remaining areas where corrections are difficult to make: Hippocampus/Amygdala and temporal lobe
3. Added the last part of FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline : statistics, overlays, etc.
