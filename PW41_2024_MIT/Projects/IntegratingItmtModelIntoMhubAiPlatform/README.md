# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The MHub.ai is a platform for deploying deep learning models in medical imaging in a user-friendly and standardized environment. This project focuses on integrating the ITMT model (Automated Deep Learning TM-segmentation to accurately measure temporalis muscle thickness) into the MHub platform. 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


The objective of this project is to successfully integrate and test the ITMT model into the MHub platform.  Additionally, we aim to get feedback on our integration method to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


- Develop integration scripts to deploy ITMT model with MHub.
- Validate the accuracy of the ITMT model within the MHub environment.






## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

During the week:
  The integration script was prepared during the week.

After the project week:
  Debug the code from the original Repo and finalize the implementation on MHUB.AI
