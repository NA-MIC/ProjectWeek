# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


[Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/)  is a framework to enhance reproducible research by standardizing models into Mhub containers that could be flexible and effortless to use. 
Therefore I aim to add two often used risk prediction models (Sybil and CVD-risk-estimator), to make it easy for the community to run such models through Mhub using a standardized way (by one simple command).



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1.  Getting more familiar with [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/)  framework, to keep pushing high quality models there for reproducible science.
2.  Publishing risk prediction Models on [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/) .



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1.  Attending MHub workshop held at PW, so that I grasp best practices.
2.  Start with a basic hands on -> [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/)  converter from DICOM to NRRD.
3.  Wrap the risk prediction models (Sybil / CVD-risk-estimator) for [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/)  Framework.
4.  Run the models on data using [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/)  and Github, to compare the simplicity of the approach, efficiency (time and effort) and output.  



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

## Before PW

1.  Getting more familiar with [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/) infrastructure and documentation.
2.  Going through [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/) tutorials.


## After PW

1. Sybil - Cancer risk prediction Model - is wrapped in MHUB.ai Framerwork and pushed to [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/).
2. CVD-Risk-Estimator - CVD risk model - is still ongoing, however at last stage.
3. Got More comfortable with [Mhub.ai](https://mhub.ai/) framework, and looking forward to add more models.
