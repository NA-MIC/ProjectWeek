# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This project will aim to integrate two models into mhub.ai.

**1. MRSegmentator:** 
- Is a segmentation model that can accurately segment 40 organs and structures in human MRI scans of the abdominal, pelvic and thorax regions. The model works on different sequence types, including T1- and T2-weighted, Dixon sequences and even CT images.
- Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06463](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06463)

**2. DeepSpA:**
- Is classification model that incorporates anatomical awareness to detect radiographic sacroiliitis. Detecting radiographic sacroiliitis plays an essential role in diagnosing and classifying axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA).  
- Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07369](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07369)





## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective: Working implementation of MRSegmentator into the mhub.ai platform.
2. Objective: Working implementation of DeepSpA into the mhub.ai platform





## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


TBD



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


TBD



# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->


Illustrations of both models can be seen on their respective GitHub pages, linked below:



# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
