# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


## Background:

Accurate landmark identification is crucial in various dental procedures. Manual identification is time-consuming and prone to errors. An AI-driven model will automate this process, offering a reliable, scalable solution.

## Goals:

1. Develop an Accurate Model: Use advanced machine learning algorithms for high-precision landmark identification.
2. Training and Validation: Train using the 3DTeethLand-MICCAI2024 dataset and validate with diverse samples.
3. Integration: Seamlessly integrate with other dental software.
4. User Interface: Create an intuitive interface in 3D Slicer for this new extension


## Methodology:

Data Collection: Use the 3DTeethLand-MICCAI2024 dataset, containing annotated 3D dental models.
Model Development: Employ deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to develop the model.

## Validation and Testing: 

Perform extensive testing with validation datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.
Software Integration: Collaborate with dental software developers for smooth integration.
User Training: Provide training and support for effective model utilization.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


Develop and validate an advanced AI model to accurately identify anatomical landmarks in dental models, enhancing precision in dental treatments, diagnostics, and educational applications.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


## Day 1 

### Data Download & Preprocessing and Exploration

Download the 3DTeethLand-MICCAI2024 dataset and explore the data structure. Visualize landmarks, surface models and setup the data for training. 

## Day 2: Model Development, Training, and Testing

### ShapeAXI models for shape analysis

Use point cloud (PC) and multi-view approaches for shape analysis. 

### Initial Model Training:
Begin training the model using the preprocessed dataset.

## Day 3: Model Validation and Fine-Tuning

### Model Validation and model refinement

- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Architecture changes

## Day 4: Integration, UI Development

### UI Design and Implementation:

Create a basic user interface in 3D Slicer.
Documentation and Presentation Preparation.
        
## Key Deliverables by End of Week:

- Preprocessed and augmented dataset.
- CNN model implemented and trained in PyTorch.
- Validated and tested model with performance metrics.
- APIs/plugins for integration with dental software.
- Functional UI in 3D Slicer.
- Project documentation and presentation materials.
