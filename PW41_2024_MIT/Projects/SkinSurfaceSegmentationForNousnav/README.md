# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This project was initiated during the [PW36](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW36_2022_Virtual/Projects/SkinSegmentation/).
It aims to create an automated skin segmentation tool for pre-operative scans for NousNav.

A model has been already trained to automatically segment scans in multi-parametric MRI. In this project, we aim to integrate the developed tool into Slicer for further integration in NousNav.




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Create a Slicer Extension for automatic skin segmentation based on a pre-trained nnUnet framework
2. Test the Slicer Extension in different settings, including different OS and different hardware configuration (only CPU, GPU, Mac)
3. Integrate the Slicer module into NousNav




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Leverage the existing SkinSegmentator Slicer extension as template
2. Create a small database that can be shared to test the algorithm in different settings
3. Discuss with the NousNav development team for its integration




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
