# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This project aims to create a Slicer extension that can automatically segment brain tumors in brain multi-parametric MRI, even in the presence of missing data.

This project will focus on two use cases where:
- all MR sequences (T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, FLAIR) are available
- only pre-contrast T1 and contrast-enhanced T1

The algorithm will not only segment the scans but also perform the required pre-processing steps (co-registration and skull-stripping).




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Develop a Slicer module that can automatically perform brain tumor segmentation
3. Create a module that has the flexibility to handle two potential sets of input data
4. Integrate pre-processing steps for end-to-end inference
5. Validate the module with a subset of BraTS and clinical data




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Train two combinations of nnUnet using the BraTS dataset.
2. Integrate the pre-trained nnUnet frameworks into Slicer using the TotalSegmentator Slicer plugin as a template
3. Leverage Slicer tools to perform the BraTS preprocessing steps
4. Collect clinical data for validation




## Progress and Next Steps
