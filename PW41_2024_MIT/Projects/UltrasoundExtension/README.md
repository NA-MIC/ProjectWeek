# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The Ultrasound extension for Slicer contains modules for ultrasound video data processing.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Standardize format of anonymized DICOM exporter by the anonymizer module.
2. Update guide and tutorials for all modules.
3. Plan future module for annotation.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Talk with people who use ultrasound in DICOM format.
2. Talk with people who need to anonymize and/or annotate ultrasound video data.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Tested anonymizer module on a new dataset.
2. Added Time Series Annotation module documentation and screenshot.
3. Working on NeedleGuide module (custom UI for interventions), WIP code available but not packaged in extension yet.
