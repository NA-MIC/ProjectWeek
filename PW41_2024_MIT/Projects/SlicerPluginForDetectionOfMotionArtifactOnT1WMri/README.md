# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We want to create a Slicer module to detect and / or quantify motion artifacts in T1 weighted MRI.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Create a Slicer module to plug our models.
2. Connect our models with Slicer (retraining might be necessary).
3. Include an estimation of uncertainty.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
