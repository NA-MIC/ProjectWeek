# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The goal of this project is to enhance the capabilities of Kaapana, an open-source platform, by enabling it to work seamlessly with DICOM data stored in Google Cloud's HealthCare API DICOM stores. Building upon the [previous](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW40_2024_GranCanaria/Projects/RunKaapanaOnGkeAndImproveConnectivityOfKaapanaToIdc/) project week's progress, we aim to further improve the connectivity and compatibility of Kaapana with Google's Healthcare API.
