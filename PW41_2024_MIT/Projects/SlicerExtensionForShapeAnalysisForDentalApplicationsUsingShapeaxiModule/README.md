# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


ShapeAXI is a shape analysis package integrating different models for shape analysis. 
ShapeAxi has demonstrated good performance on Cleft defects and to some extent condylar shape degeneration. We propose to create an extension of classification for different datasets.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


- Build and deploy an extension for 3D-slicer for the classification of cleft defects, airway obstructions, and condyles degeneration
- The extension should be used by anyone including clinicians to help them in diagnosis with ready-to-use models
- Add Grad-CAM visualization to help clinicians understand the decision-making process and check if highlights are coherent with existing knowledge




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


- Create and develop the slicer extension with a User Interface
- Integrate shapeAxi module and models
- Documentation and user guides
- Distribution of extension




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Progress
- Models have been trained for cleft and. condyles
- Newest models are being tested on airways (4 classes) 
- A little work has been done on the extension
2. Next steps
- Make sure all preliminary steps have no issue 
- Integrating shapeaxi package 
- Testing of UI to improve accessibility
