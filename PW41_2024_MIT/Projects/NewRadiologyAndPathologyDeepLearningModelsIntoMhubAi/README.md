# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The MHub.ai project at Harvard has developed methods to execute machine learning models on medical images in an easy to use and standardized way.  There is already a Slicer plugin for running MHub.ai format models.  For this project, we propose to add two models of row different types to the MHub library. 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A.  Test a MONAI-based deep learning model in MHub and validate the instructions for new developers to follow.

2. Objective B. Evaluate how well the MHub approach works for supporting pathology models in addition to radiology models.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


Step 1. Port one of the pre-trained MONAIAutoSeg3D radiology models developed at Queens (by Andros Lasso et al.) for execution using the MHub framework as a docker container.  Test the MHub I/O converters to read a  DICOM image and reformat as needed from the input.   Write out a DICOM segmentation object as the result.

Step 2. Start converting a published pathology DNN model (Rhabdomyosarcoma segmentation) for the MHub framework.  This will Evaluate how well the MHub approach works for supporting pathology models in addition to radiology models.  For example, can the same base Docker image work for pathology?



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
