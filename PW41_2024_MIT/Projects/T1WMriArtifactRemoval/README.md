# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


I will train a Generative Convolutional Neural Network to remove artifacts (motion, ghosting, metal artifacts, etc.) from T1w MRI images.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. In the end, I plan to have a trained deep learning model and statistics on its performance. 



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. I will write a Python program to generate artificial artifacts on TW1 MRI images. I will then train a CNN with the images with artificial artifacts as the input, and the original images without the artifacts as the output. Its performance will be evaluated on real data. 



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
