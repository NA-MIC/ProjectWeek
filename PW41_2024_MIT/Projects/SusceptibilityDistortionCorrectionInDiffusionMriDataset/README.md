# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The aim of this project is to mitigate susceptibility distortions in dMRI dataset by offering a deep learning solution as an alternative of traditional state-of-the-arts methods, only using a single blip-up or blip-down image.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Simplifying dMRI acquisition protocols by utilizing just one of the blip-up or blip-down image as input for the model. This approach can reduce scan time, potentially halving the duration of dMRI acquisitions. 

2. Objective B. Facilitating more precise analysis and promoting advancements in our understanding of brain by equipping researchers with more efficient and accurate tools.
