# Project Description

Integration of SOFA Framework into Unity in order to develop a haptics-enabled training simulator in virtual reality for intravenous catheter insertion using ultrasound guidance.

The objective is to develop a realistic haptic model for both the catheter insertion and ultrasound manipulation using Unity and SOFA framework.

## Objectives

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Become familiar with SOFA Framework for haptics
2. Integrate SOFA Framework into Unity using InfinyTech's plugin solution
3. Integrate usage of Haply's Inverse3 haptic robot through SOFA in Unity

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.-->

1. Complete the SOFA Training introduction course 
2. Follow InfinyTech3D integration guide for Unity integration of Inverse3
3. Ask the slicer-sofa project community or the SOFA Framework community for input if needed

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Integration of Haply Inverse3 into Unity (without SOFA Framework) for a generic needle insertion prototype
2. Implementation of a custom collision detection system using the Haply Inverse3
3. Implementation of spring-based haptic model for generic needle insertion
4. Incomplete : collision detection taking into account the whole shaft of the catheter needle, deformation of arm model used

     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
