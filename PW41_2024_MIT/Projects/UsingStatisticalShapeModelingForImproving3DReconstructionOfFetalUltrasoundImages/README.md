# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We are initiating a multi-center (led by Dr. Emet Schneiderman) study to understand the impact of maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and different treatment plans (i.e., mouth appliances) on both pregnant women and fetuses, including fetal craniofacial dysmorphology and growth issues. A large sample size of ultrasound images will be collected. However, the fetuses may have different poses and partial face covered, and the ultrasonographic images have lots of noise. We are interested in using statistical modeling to refine 3D segmentation to diagnose fetal orofacial dysmorphology, reconstruct 3D growth trajectories, explore epigenetic effects of facial growth problems and dysmorphology, predict newborn facial shapes, etc. 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Use statistical shape modeling tools or other tools from Slicer and Kitware to refine 3D reconstruct of fetal faces based on ultrasonography. Aesthetics is also important because part of the goal is to make parents aware of the sleep treatment.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Segmentation of noisy US images
2. Learn and explore techniques in statistical shape modeling and ultrasound image processing using 3D slicer and other tools developed by Kitware; set up a plan.
3. Locate sample data for experimenting.
4. Develop potential collaborations




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Preparing grant application and data collection plans
2. See above
