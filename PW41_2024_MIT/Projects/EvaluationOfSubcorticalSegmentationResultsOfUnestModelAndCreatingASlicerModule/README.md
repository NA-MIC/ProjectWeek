# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We will inspect the results of subcortical segmentations of Unest model visually and will try to improve these results. Also we will try to build a module in slicer .

## Progress and Next Steps

I debugged the initial error for the extension. Currently, I am working on the inference section of the unest model and the next step would be to implement the ensemble section of it.
