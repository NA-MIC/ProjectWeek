# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We will visually evaluate and inspect the outputs obtained from the cortical surface reconstructions generated by our designed model. We will ensure the accuracy and correctness of these reconstructions, focusing on white matter and pial surfaces to assess their structural integrity and reliability.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A: Visually evaluate cortical surface reconstructions from MRI images. Focus on assessing white matter and pial surfaces in .stl and .ply formats to ensure high-quality reconstructions.
2. Objective B: Visualize and inspect these reconstructions using 3D Slicer. Examine surface topology and detect self-intersections to ensure structural integrity and accuracy.
