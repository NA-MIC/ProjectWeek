# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The Planning Module for Left Ventricle Assist Device (LVAD) Implantation is aimed at developing a state-of-the-art tool to improve the precision and efficacy of LVAD placement surgeries. This module integrates advanced AI-based automatic 3D segmentation, mechanical simulations of heart muscle deformation, and an algorithm for automatic LVAD positioning, drawing from extensive clinical experience. The project seeks to enhance patient safety and surgical outcomes by providing surgeons with precise, patient-specific models and simulations, ultimately bridging engineering advancements with critical cardiac surgical applications.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


This week, I will draft the algorithm for automatic LVAD positioning, incorporating clinical insights and surgical best practices. I will also begin iterative testing and refinement to ensure precise and effective device placement.



## Approach and Plan
