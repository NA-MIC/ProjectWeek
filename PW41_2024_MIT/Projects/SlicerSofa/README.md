# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Slicer-SOFA was born during [PW40](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW40_2024_GranCanaria/Projects/SlicerSofaIntegration/) with the aim to support the use of the SOFA simulation library within 3D Slicer. This project will continue the development of the extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Engage with the community to understand the needs and possibilities
2. Establish a roadmap for future development of the Slicer-SOFA extension
  - Extension architecture to support simulation modules [RafaelPalomar/Slicer-SOFA#15](https://github.com/RafaelPalomar/Slicer-SOFA/issues/15)
  -  Distribution of third-party libraries [RafaelPalomar/Slicer-SOFA#14](https://github.com/RafaelPalomar/Slicer-SOFA/issues/14)
  - ...



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Meetings with the community, the SOFA and 3D Slicer developers.
2. Add new example modules
3. Add documentation
4. Bug fixes and extension release



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

* Tested Slicer-SOFA extension on mac os build
    * Requires a local slicer build (tested on debug, see notes below for details)
    * Issues
    	* Turning off Qt and OpenGL dependencies doesn't seem to work - it would be best to build just the core simulation and python wrapping.
     	* Building in release mode didn't recognize libaries

# Notes

## Mac OS build
    * Configure and make:
      ```
      cmake \
	      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug \
	      -DSlicer_DIR:PATH=${SLICER_BUILD} \
      	-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:STRING=11.0 \
      	../Slicer-SOFA

      make -j50 |& tee log
      ```
  * Launch:
    ```
    export SLICERSOFA_DIR=/Users/pieper/slicer/latest/SOFA
    export SLICER_DIR=/opt/s
        SOFA_ROOT=${SLICERSOFA_DIR}/Slicer-SOFA-build/SOFA-build \
        ${SLICER_DIR}/Slicer-build/Slicer \
        --launcher-additional-settings ${DIR}/Slicer-SOFA-build/inner-build/AdditionalLauncherSettings.ini
    ```
  * Then paste a [script like this](https://github.com/pieper/Slicer-SOFA/blob/main/Experiments/lung.py) into the python console.
