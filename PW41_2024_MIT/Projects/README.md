# How to create a new project

- Post questions about the project idea and team on the [Project Week forum][forum], our communication mechanism as of PW28.
- When you are ready, add a new entry in the list of **Projects** by creating a new `README.md` file in subfolder in `Projects` folder, and copying contents of [project description template][project-description-template] file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
    * If the link does not work (https issues) please try [here](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/blob/master/PW41_2024_MIT/Projects/Template/README.md)
3. Go back to [Projects](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW41_2024_MIT/Projects) folder on GitHub
4. Click on "Create new file" button
5. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`  
    - When naming the file, **please ensure there are no spaces/special characters in the folder or file name**
6. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
7. Update at least your project's __title, category, key investigators, location, and project description sections__
8. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with the new page
