# Description

The goal of this breakout session is to gather all parties interested in the future of rendering in VTK and Slicer, present ongoing development by Kitware and others and discuss potential future directions and clinical and biomedical needs.

## Topics

* VTK Evolution
  * Status of the replacement for OpenGL (WebGPU)
  * Integration of VTK and VTK.js (common shaders?)
* Rendering
  * Global illumination
  * Support for high resolution volumes
  * Support for shared graphics contexts
  * Support for GPU pre-processing of volumes and meshes
  * Creation of an experimental rendering module:
    * Support for multiple volumes/surfaces handled by the same pipeline
    * Modifiable shaders
    * Multipass rendering
    * Arbitrary number of transfer functions
    * Better support for animation and high-resolution rendering
* AR-VR
  * New Slicer Mixed-Reality module (for Hololens remoting)
  * Support for OpenXR in Slicer Virtual Reality module
  * Status of WebXR in vtk.js
