With the [Project Week GitHub Issue page](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/issues/new/choose), you have three options to create your Project Page:

1.    [Create a Proposal](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/issues/new?assignees=drouin-simon%2Cpiiq%2Crafaelpalomar%2Csjh26%2Ctkapur&labels=proposal%2Cevent%3APW39_2023_Montreal&projects=&template=proposal.yml&title=Proposal%3A+) issue: If you have an idea for a project page but are not quite ready to create it yet, you can create a “Proposal” issue.

2.    [Create a Project](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/issues/new?assignees=drouin-simon%2Cpiiq%2Crafaelpalomar%2Csjh26%2Ctkapur&labels=project%2Cevent%3APW39_2023_Montreal&projects=&template=project.yml&title=Project%3A+) issue: If you are ready to create your page, you can simply create a “Project” issue. This issue will allow you to fill out a convenient form to provide the necessary details.

3.    [Create the project page yourself using the template](Projects/Readme.md): If you prefer to create the Project Page yourself, you can still do so by using the provided template and submitting a pull request.
