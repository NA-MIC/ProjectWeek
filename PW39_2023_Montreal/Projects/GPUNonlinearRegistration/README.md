# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
This project aims to add a multimodal nonlinear registration plugin to Slicer. This work extends the functionality of [GPU Rigid Registration project](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/blob/master/PW35_2021_Virtual/Projects/GPURigidRegistration/README.md) (which was initially part of [Ibis Neuronav](http://ibisneuronav.org/)). This project is based on [Multi-Modal Image Registration Based on Gradient Orientations of Minimal Uncertainty](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6298013).
## Objective
<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Be able to nonlinearly register a source image to a target image from different modalities

## Approach and Plan
<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. Figure out what needs to be changed compared to rigid registration
2. Add required components
3. Test

## Progress
1. Theoretical foundation of the method has been investigated
2. Previous implementation has been reviewed
3. Start with CPU implementation of non-rigid registration in Ibis

## Next setps
1. Replace metric value computation with OpenCL code
