# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The goal of SlicerROS2 is to provide an open-source software platform for medical robotics research. Specifically, the project focuses on architectures to seamlessly integrate a robot system with medical image computing software using two popular open-source software packages: Robot Operating System (ROS) and 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Demo - Set up a live demo using SlicerROS2 and [myCobot](https://www.elephantrobotics.com/en/mycobot-en/).
2.  Dissemination - Review and improve online documentation for rosmed.github.io
3.  Plan - Discuss future directions and maintenance (other potential projects, integration into nightly build, etc).

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Set up a build environment on a laptop with Ubuntu 22.04
2.  Set up myCobot

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
