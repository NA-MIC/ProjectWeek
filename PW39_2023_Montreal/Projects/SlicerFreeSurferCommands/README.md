# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Run FreeSurfer commands using 3D Slicer's graphical user interface.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Get feedback on use and implementation of the modules from other Slicer users and developers.
2. Develop additional modules for other commands (e.g. SynthSeg).
3. Package SlicerCBM modules as an installable 3D Slicer extension.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Demonstrate modules to Slicer users and developers.
2. Discuss the implementation of the modules with Slicer developers.
3. Modify modules based on feedback from Slicer developers.
4. Complete the [New extension checklist](https://github.com/SlicerCBM/SlicerFreeSurferCommands/issues/1).

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Developed Python scripted and CLI modules for FreeSurfer's SynthStrip command for skull stripping.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
