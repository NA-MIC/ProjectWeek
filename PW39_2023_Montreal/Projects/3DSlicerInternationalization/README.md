# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The goal of the project is to facilitate access to 3D Slicer in non-English speaking countries and foster global community engagement.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

To identify members of the global Slicer community interested in new Slicer activities in their language

To create a list containing the top 10 Slicer modules to translate for new Slicer Internationalization contributors

To create a new module translation lookup table for the Language Packs Extension tutorial

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

### Slice Internationalization Breakout session:

* Monday, June 12, 2-4 pm EST

Zoom link for Slicer Internationalization Breakout session: https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86060017076?pwd=NmVkb2ovckh6Y3ZjQzZxSUtXU09tZz09#success

### Daily Slicer internationalization sessions with members of the Slicer community

Zoom link for all Slicer Internationalization sessions: https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86060017076?pwd=NmVkb2ovckh6Y3ZjQzZxSUtXU09tZz09#success

* Tuesday, June 13, 9:30-10:30 am EST

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
     
* Daily Slicer Internationalization sessions with over 20 participants from Africa, Latin America, North America and Europe

* Added the Module translation lookup table to the Slicer Language Packs repository. Click [here](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLanguagePacks/blob/main/Module%20translation%20lookup%20table.md) to view it!

* [Excel worksheet with language selection](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLanguagePacks/releases/tag/TranslationResources)

* Find Text tool of the Language Packs Extension. Click [here](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLanguagePacks/blob/main/TranslationGuidelines.md#:~:text=Find%20Text%20tool%20of%20the%20Language%20Packs%20Extension)
