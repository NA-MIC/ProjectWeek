# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

ShapeAXI is an innovative project that focuses on advancing the field of shape analysis, exploration, and interpretability through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The project aims to develop novel algorithms and tools that can effectively analyze and interpret complex shapes, enabling deeper insights and understanding in various domains such as computer vision, computer graphics, and biomedical imaging. By harnessing the power of AI, ShapeAXI aims to revolutionize shape analysis by automating the process of shape exploration, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful information. The project strives to enhance interpretability, enabling users to comprehend and interpret the underlying structure and characteristics of shapes with greater clarity. ShapeAXI holds the promise of unlocking new possibilities in shape-related research and applications, ultimately leading to advancements in fields such as object recognition, shape synthesis, and shape-based decision-making systems.


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Develop advanced shape analysis algorithms: Design and develop cutting-edge algorithms that can efficiently analyze and process complex shapes, encompassing both 2D and 3D domains.
