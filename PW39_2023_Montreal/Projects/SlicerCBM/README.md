# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

SlicerCBM is an extension for 3D Slicer that provides tools for creating and solving computational models of biophysical systems and processes with a focus on clinical and biomedical applications. Features include grid generation, assignment of material properties and boundary conditions, and solvers for biomechanical modeling and biomechanics-based non-rigid image registration.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Package SlicerCBM modules as an installable 3D Slicer extension.

2. Improve documentation of individual modules and workflow.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Complete the requirements for a new 3D Slicer extension (<https://github.com/SlicerCBM/SlicerCBM/issues/8>)

2. Add the SlicerCBM extension to the  Slicer Extensions Catalog.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
