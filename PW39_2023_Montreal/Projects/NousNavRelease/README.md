# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
NousNav is an ongoing project led by Dr. Alex Golby at Brigham and Women's Hospital to build and disseminate a low-cost neuronavigation system. Built as a 3D Slicer Custom App, NousNav uses low cost optical tracking (Optitrack Duo) in combination with custom optically-tracked tools and reference arrays to facilitate patient registration, procedure planning, and navigation.

For this project we are going to finalize remaining issues on the tracker to move towards a 1.0 release
