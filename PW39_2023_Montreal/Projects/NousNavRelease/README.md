# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
NousNav is an ongoing project led by Dr. Alex Golby at Brigham and Women's Hospital to build and disseminate a low-cost neuronavigation system. Built as a 3D Slicer Custom App, NousNav uses low cost optical tracking (Optitrack Duo) in combination with custom optically-tracked tools and reference arrays to facilitate patient registration, procedure planning, and navigation.

For this project we are going to finalize remaining issues on the tracker to move towards a 1.0 release

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Triage existing issues into a major/minor release tasks
1. Clear issues for the 1.0 Release

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

Major tasks to work on:

1. DICOM patient management
    1. Storage of MRBs as secondary captures
    1. Store XML only?
1. Landmarks management rework
    1. Granular color management
    1. Single landmarks class
1. LPS orientation in Nav phase

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Reworked the registration landmark support.
    1. Support any sufficient subset of the complete landmark list
    2. Registration picking provides better control of order of landmark collection
    3. Improved color consistency across landmark usage
2. Made patient interface styling consistent with rest of application
3. Demo'd recent changes to the rest of the NousNav team
4. Discussed with other IGT devs the best way to reuse NousNav effort in other projects
    1. Slicer NavigationAppTemplate: core functionality of the NousNav workflow made available as a reusable template similar to SlicerCAT
5. Will tag the 1.0 release at the end of this week.
