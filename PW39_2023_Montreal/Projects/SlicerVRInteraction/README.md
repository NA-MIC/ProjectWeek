# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The main controller interactions in SlicerVR have been broken for about a year, some interaction types even longer. It would be crucial for keeping SlicerVR usable to make the interactions work again.

Kitware and Robarts (Jean-Christophe Fillion Robin, Lucas Gandel, Sankhesh Jhaveri, Adam Rankin) have been investing resources and effort in rehauling the AR/VR backend in VTK for a while, thus now we have a new OpenXR backend and restructured libraries SlicerVR is built on. The goal is to give a small push to their efforts in terms of SlicerVR interactions during the project week, towards restoring at least the previous feature set.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

In PW 37, basic interaction has been fixed. 

1. Fix the two-controller world move/zoom (i.e. 3D pinch) 
2. Customization of controller buttons. Either via the
    * Method in-place (functions integrated [here](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/pull/87), see also [here](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/pull/83))
    * Json manifest files (see [here](https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/tree/master/Rendering/OpenVR))

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Set up a VR workstations at ETS to be able to test and develop
2. Fix two hands interactions
3. Implement custom interaction to test both customization methods

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Fixed 3D pinch interaction in commit [SlicerVirtualReality@49f1896d6](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/commit/49f1896d652c6b27051cd41e8244b52cd28c2dab)
2. Rebased the GUI widgets branch into a [new branch](https://github.com/cpinter/SlicerVirtualReality/tree/gui-widget-20230612)
3. Fixed lookup of `vtk_openvr_actions.json` and `vtk_openvr_binding_*.json` files for both build and install tree. See commit [SlicerVirtualReality@a4d465b73](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/commit/a4d465b7321a6cdd2e0c3aa85eb04899be471b17) integrated through [PR-117](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/pull/117)
4. Make in-VR GUI widget work (with many workarounds and limitations)
