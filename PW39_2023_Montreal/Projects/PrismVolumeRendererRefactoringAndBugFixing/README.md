# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The goal of this project is to enable the development of advanced 3D rendering techniques in Slicer. The goal is to facilitate access to GPU shaders and enable GPU-based filtering in Slicer by improving shader access multipass rendering in VTK and Slicer. The [PRISM Module](https://github.com/ETS-vis-interactive/SlicerPRISMRendering) in Slicer will serve as a test environment for the new capabilities.

PRISM has a significant amount of unused and/or legacy code that was made for version 4.11, which isn't used anymore. The goal of the project is to simplify PRISM volume renderer to make it easier to work with and to remove as many bugs as possible.
