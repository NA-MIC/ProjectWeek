# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The goal of this project is to extend the Volume Rendering interface to improve the convenience of multiple volume comparisons. We aim to create and test prototypes of features that will be added to the SlicerMorph extension in the short term and discuss appropriateness of integration into Slicer core.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Features to support multiple volume comparisons:

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Objective A: Create module to manage two relative views, manage nodes displayed/transformed in each
2.  Objective B: Create prototype that links individual rendering properties of each volume in a folder.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Created a Python function to link/unlink relative views.
