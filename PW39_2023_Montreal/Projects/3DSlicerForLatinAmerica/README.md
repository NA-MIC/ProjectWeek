# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The goal of this project is to empower the biomedical research community in Latin America by localizing 3D Slicer to Spanish and Portuguese and improving tutorial localization infrastructure.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  To identify members of the Latin American community interested in 3D Slicer activities in Spanish and in Portuguese
2.  To run daily translation hackathons at PW39

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

### Slice Internationalization Breakout session:

* Monday, June 12, 2-4 pm EST

### Daily Slicer internationalization sessions with members of the Slicer community

* Tuesday, June 13, 9-11 am EST
* Wednesday, June 14, 10-11 am EST
* Thursday, June 15, 10-11 am EST

## Progress and Next Steps
