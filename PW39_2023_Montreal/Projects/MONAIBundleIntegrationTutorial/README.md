# Project Description

NVIDIA AI assisted annotation (AIAA) is no longer actively mainatined and MONAI bundle has been established to load a wide selection of pretrained models for radiology and pathology. 


## Objective


Our objective is to provide a detailed step by step description on how to use MONAI bundle for this task.

## Step by Step Description

Setting up an AWS EC2 Windows server in the cloud: 
The detailed process [is decribed here](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/SlicerCloud/).

Install MONAILabel

Do a “cd $home”, to the place where the  MONAILabel folder will be created. 

Firstly, begin by uninstalling the existing MONAILabel and Monai installations, because as of 6/2023 we need a special MONAI version to make this word. 
This is accomplished by running the following commands in the terminal:

    pip uninstall monailabel
    pip uninstall monai

Then, follow to our outlined procedures for setting up MONAILabel from scratch. 
Please refer to [these instructions](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW37_2022_Virtual/Projects/MONAILabelLung/MONAILabel_Installation.html), they can be found on our Project Week webpage 1.

Follow these guidelines until reaching the command to set the MONAILabel script paths:

    $Env:PATH += ";C:\Users\yourname\MONAILabel\monailabel\scripts"

After setting the paths, the next step is to installed Monai in a special version (this may change in future and will be adopted):

    pip install monai==1.2.0rc6

After a “cd $home”, where the  MONAILabel folder is located, the start_server command can be  issued:

    monailabel start_server --app MONAILabel/sample-apps/monaibundle --studies c:/Data/Task06_Lung/imagesTr --conf models lung_nodule_ct_detection

After this command, the correct and requested model is automatically loaded from the [Monai Model Zoo](https://monai.io/model-zoo.html), which is a highly commendable feature.

Then proceeded to test the setup with the 3D Slicer and the MONAILabel extension using the CT Chest dataset. 

It is great to see that the AI successfully detects some nodules!

Sidenote: The process was implemented on an AWS EC2 Windows server instance with an A10G GPU (24 GB dedicated video RAM).


## Approach and Plan

During the workshop, create the wholeBody_ct_segmentation MONAILabel model on an AWS EC2 Windows instance.

We'll attempt using the server simultaneously from various places while documenting the installation procedure. 

The IP address of the MONAILabel server is http://52.209.177.211:8000/. During the Project week (Monday through Wednesday), the server will be accessible daily from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time. 

## Progress and Next Steps

We held three workshpos during the conference with good success. In each of the workshops we were able to 

- reliably connect to the AWS server instance
- start MONAILabel
- use the monaibundle app
- load one of the two demonstrated models
- start 3D Slicer on the server
- perform inference with the preconfigured model
- demonstrate label adjustments
- submit labels
- work from remote on the AWS server instance
- answer first-timer questions
