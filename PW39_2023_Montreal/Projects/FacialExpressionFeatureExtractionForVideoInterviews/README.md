# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Put together code that 1) performs facial expression feature extraction for video interviews stored on a data aggregation server, and 2) transfers them to a local directory. It would be based on existing scripts for facial expression feature extraction and an existing data management tool. This project is part of the AMP SCZ program, an initiative for early detection of risk for schizophrenia (https://www.ampscz.org).

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective 1: Adapt our existing code for facial expression analysis to extract features through a proper video pipeline, including running this task for upcoming videos in the data aggregation server.
2.  Objective 2: Adapt our data management tool to incorporate the files generated by this pipeline for data transfer.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
