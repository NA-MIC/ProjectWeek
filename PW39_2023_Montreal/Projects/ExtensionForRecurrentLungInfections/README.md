# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The objective is to create an extension capable of identifying lung lesions of different ages following repetitive infections.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

In order to use the extension in pulmonology to correlate a recent symptomatology with an X-ray image having images related to old infections

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1 Collect radiographs of 2 groups of patients (A with an ongoing infection, B having recovered from an infection but with sequelae images)
2\. Compare the hounsfied of the different lesions and create a threshold for the 2 groups.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

I am looking for scanner images of patients meeting my criteria
