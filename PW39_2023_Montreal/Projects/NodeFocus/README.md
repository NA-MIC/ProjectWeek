# Project Description

3D software applications often provide feedback mechanisms for selecting objects and showing users which objects they have selected, or are interacting with. This allows some visualizations to be hidden when the object is not in focus.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

This project aims to implement a similar node selection system in 3D Slicer, allowing users to:
- See the nodes that they are hovering over or interacting with in the various subject hierarchy trees or node selectors.
- Select nodes by clicking on them in one of the views.

If you would like to offer suggestions or feedback on the current prototype, then come see me in-person.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Continue development of the node focus infrastructure.
2. Get feedback from hands-on use to better improve the implementation.
3. Improve visualization and performance.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Prototype implementation can be found here: https://github.com/Sunderlandkyl/Slicer/tree/focus_node_prototype
2. Improve rendering of volumes + hard selection.
3. Implement picking of node types other than markups.
