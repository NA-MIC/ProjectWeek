# Project Description
This project propose a tool to automatically register intra oral scan of upper jaw. The method can register growth and non-growing patient. 
The registration method is based on neural network to create a region of interest on the palate, and ICP (Iterest Closest Point) to register. 
The neural network has been trained with extraction and non-extraction case, growing and non-growing patient to have robust neural network. 
We will leave the option to the users to also register the mandible by applying the transformation matrix of the maxilla to the mandible.

The actual code is on this [repository](https://github.com/HUTIN1/ALIDDM/tree/refactoring/py/Palete/CNN). 

## Objective 
1. Start to implement automatic registration of IOS in Slicer
2. Deploy Areg 

## Approach And Plan
1. Find a method to perform Automatic Registration of IOS
2. Train a neural network to create a region of interest
3. Implement automatic registration for region of interest


## Progress and Next Steps
### Progress 
1. Method and script working
2. User Interface

### Next Steps
1. Implement the method in [Areg](https://github.com/lucanchling/AREG)
2. Deploy Areg in [SlicerAutomatedDentalTools](https://github.com/DCBIA-OrthoLab/SlicerAutomatedDentalTools) to be available to all users
