# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Add an annotation of type "Pedicle screw" to Cornerstone3D.
Import pedicle screws from Slicer3D planning through file or real-time  (fhircast like).




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. View pedicle screw surgical planning in OHIF in MPR and VRT.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Add an annotation type to Cornerstone3D.
2. Make it render in both orthographic and volume3d volume rendering .
3. Look into exporting pedicle screw information in slicer3D modules.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
