# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


OHIF  i18n translation tags were recently updated with @500 additional tags so that all labels are now covered.  This means that AI can easily add new languages but we need someone to validate it and fix errors like “DICOM store” translated to “Magasin DICOM” for example. 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


Provide the opportunity to project week attendees to add or update  a language they care about to OHIF.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->



Attendees who want to add/update a language can add themselves to the project with the language they target.  
The AI language translation will be available soon after at:

https://na-mic-projectweek44-g0g4a5c5dgc5dcf3.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/

The language can be selected in the "Preferences"  section of the top right sprocket icon.
During the conference, project participants can schedule a 1 hour meeting with Martin to correct the translation.





## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
