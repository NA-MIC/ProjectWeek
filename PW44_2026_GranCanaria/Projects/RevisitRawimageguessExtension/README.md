# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We created this extension not too long ago.
By using this extension you can find out the parameters of work file types and formats that Slicer doesn't handle out of the box. This way you can create an .nhdr with the parameters of the images(series), and then load them into Slicer.

## Approach and Plan

## Progress and Next Steps
