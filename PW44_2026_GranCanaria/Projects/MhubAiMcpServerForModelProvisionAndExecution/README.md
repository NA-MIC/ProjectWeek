# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


MCP servers have significantly shaped and improved the abilities of agentic AI systems. They provide AI agents with structured, on-demand capabilities (tools) and information (resources / promts). The aim is, to enable AI systems to **find** suitable AI models, **answer questions** about specific models and upon request **run** suitable AI models. The secondary aim is to enable **automatic conversion of open source models into** the **MHub.ai** deployment format.

In this project, we want to enable AI agents to interact with MHub.ai models by providing a (local) MCP server for MHub.ai. The public api, structured metadata and output-level information (e.g., anatomic structures segmented by each model) are already present and can be directly exposed through the server. The detailed technical documentation and step-by-step tutorials furthermore might already be a decent starting point to automatically generate MHub.ai project structure, Dockerfile, Module wrapper class, default workflow configuration and metadata json, to automate or speed-up the contribution process.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Local MCP server to interact with the MHub.ai model repository
2. Provision of tools and guidelines for automatic model deployment



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


We developed a public PoC Skill that can discover, run and adapt MHub models, the skill can be found under
https://github.com/MHubAI/MHubSkill.
