# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


[claude-scientific-skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills) introduces a development pattern to describe tools and resources usable in scientific research via a human-readable document, accompanied by code samples and recipes covering key functionality of the resource. Further, the company maintaining that repository makes the resulting skills accessible via MCP server, which could be connected with an agentic dev platform to improve quality of responses. The goal of this project is to add a new skill to the aforementioned repo to cover [Imaging Data Commons](https://learn.canceridc.dev/).



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. IDC skill is available in [https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills)
2. Feedback and use cases collected from the community



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Analyze existing skills, understand best practices.
2. Develop the IDC skill.
3. Submit a PR with the IDC skill.
4. Compare responses of LLM with and without using the `claude-scientific-skills` MCP server.
5. Evaluate usability of the skill using the questions from IDC forum, or any other questions from the community.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Set up Claude.AI with the `claude-scientific-skills` MCP server, experiment.
2. Started setting up the skill layout and deciding what should be covered.



# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->


_No response_



# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
