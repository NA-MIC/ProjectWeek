# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Make an orientation marker for OHIF whose 26 surfaces (6 faces, 8 corners and 12 edges) can be clicked to reorient the volume in 3D/VRT viewport.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


Enhanced usability of 3D viewport.  
Provide volume orientation control when the rotate tool is rotating the clipping planes.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


Seek advice on implementation (VTK, cornerstone,....)




## Progress and Next Steps


VTK polygon cornerstone tool that adds edges and corners to the existing AnnotatedCube.
