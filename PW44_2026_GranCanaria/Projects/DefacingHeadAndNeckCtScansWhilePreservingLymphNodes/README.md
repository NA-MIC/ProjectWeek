# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


For the Lymph Node Quantification project we want to analyze and share head and neck scans but don't want to share PHI.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Use generic segmentation tools (CADS, SuperSynth, etc.)
2. Identify facial feature landmarks.  Find existing models or examples that identify features like corners of eyes and mouth
3. Figure out which features can be reliably detected that define a reasonable identity removal but leaving the nodes in the cheeks and jaw
4. Decide what bluring or removal to do in the identified face area



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


* Figure out if existing MR defacing tools can be used for this, perhaps by mapping the CT to MR



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
