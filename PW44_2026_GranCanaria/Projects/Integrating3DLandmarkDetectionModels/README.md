# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We developed a framework for 3D medical landmark detection, based on a U-Net and heatmap regression. The method was evaluated on several public datasets. We want to make these trained models available within a slicer extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


Within the extension, users should be able to:
1) Choose and run a model for prediction.
2) Visualize predicted landmarks.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

We have adjusted the SlicerNNUnet extension to apply nnLandmark instead.
