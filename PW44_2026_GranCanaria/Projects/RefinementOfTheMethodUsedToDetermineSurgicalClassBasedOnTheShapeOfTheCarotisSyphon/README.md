# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This is an [ongoing project from last year](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW42_2025_GranCanaria/Projects/DeterminationOfSurgicalClassBasedOnTheCurvatureAndShapeOfTheCarotidSyphon/).

Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide of which ischaemic stroke is the more common. Mechanical thrombectomy involves inserting a catheter into the cerebral vasculature to remove blood clot. Catheter devices with different parameters are available to perform the procedure of which the correct one must be selected beforehand to avoid blockage. Clinical experience suggests that large lumen aspiration catheters were most commonly stuck at the anterior curvature of the carotid syphon.

We categorised 53 studies into four groups. Previously, we extracted nine features based on vessel geometry for classification purposes.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Our main objective is to refine the extracted attribute values in order to enhance the classification results.
2. Vessel segmentation is also part of the process that is performed manually currently. We are trying to make it automatic.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Using Weka, figure out what features and classification method provide the best result.
2. We plan to gather CT and ground truth data for MONAI Auto3dSeg segmentation training.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
