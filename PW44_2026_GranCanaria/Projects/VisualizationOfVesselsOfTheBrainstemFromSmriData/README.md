# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


About 7% of COVID-19 survivors experience long-lasting symptoms known as long-COVID. There is no proven cure for long-COVID, nor do we know the pathology of the syndrome. Our research project aims to understand how changes in the brain, specifically the white matter, contribute to the symptoms of the neuropsychiatric subtype of long-COVID. 

The brain white matter fiber tract of interest to us is the dorsal vagal complex-corticolimbic fiber system (DVC-CLFS), which connects the brainstem and the frontal brain areas (Kikinis et al. 2024).

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


In the past project weeks, we have established the protocol for delineating the fiber tract from MRI images using 3D Slicer. During this week, I will reconstruct the fiber tract from additional study subjects.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


I will use diffusion and structural MRI, specifically whole-brain tractography and T1 images, from subjects with and without long-COVID to identify the DVC-CLFS fiber tract in its entirety, extending from the frontal lobe to the brainstem.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
