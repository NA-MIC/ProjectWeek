# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The brainstem is of new interest to neuroimaging. We have noticed a deformed shape of the brainstem in several healthy participants. We believe that the shape deformation is caused by the vessels.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. We aim to reconstruct and visualize the vessels around the brainstem.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Use 3dSlicer extension and help.
Using the Extension like VMTK (Vessel Analysis Toolkit), unless there is an update.





## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
