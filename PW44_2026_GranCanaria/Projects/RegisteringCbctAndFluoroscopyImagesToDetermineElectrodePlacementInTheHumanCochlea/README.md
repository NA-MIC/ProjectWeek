# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Cochlear implant electrode placeemnt is exteremely important during cochlear surgery, as inserting it as close as possible to the modiolus produces the best results (lower energy consumption of the device, better hearing outcomes, speec recognition ans so on).
But it is an imaging nightmare: imeging the inner ear isn't that easy, and doing so with metal inserted is even more challenging. One of the best option is to use fluroscopy images, but then we lose the 3rd dimension.
If we could register the two modalities, we could have the desired accuracy and extend the measurements into 3D.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


Brainstorm about ideas, and maybe create a prototype using example data.

- Collect ideas
- Collect even more ideas
- Hopefully create a prototype



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->



- Examine the CBCT and fluoroscopy images and identify the points. One for sure is that the CBCT images have bad distances, as usual...
- Try to overlay/register fluoroscopy images using anatomical landmarks



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
