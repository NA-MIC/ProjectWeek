# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

SlicerCBM is an extension for 3D Slicer that provides tools for creating and solving computational models of biophysical systems and processes with a focus on clinical and biomedical applications. Features include grid generation, assignment of material properties and boundary conditions, and solvers for biomechanical modeling and biomechanics-based non-rigid image registration.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Submit to Extension Index
2. Update documentation
3. Fix bugs and improve code
4. Add automated tests

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

### 1. Submit to Extension Index

- Complete submission requirements
- Address reviewer feedback

### 2. Update documentation

- Rewrite tutorials on slicercbm.org ([#55](https://github.com/SlicerCBM/SlicerCBM/issues/55))
- Add module usage examples

### 3. Fix bugs and improve code

- Fix critical module bugs
- Improve Slicer integration (MRML nodes, VTK formats)

### 4. Add automated tests

- Write unit tests for core modules

## Progress and Next Steps
