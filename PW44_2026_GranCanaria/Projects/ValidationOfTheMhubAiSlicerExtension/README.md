# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The MHub.ai Slicer Extension gives direct access to ~30 models from within 3D Slicer. 
We want to finalize the extension and provide a stable use experience, focusing on guidance during the setup phase (e.g., how do I install Docker) and improving the integration and functionality.

A core part of this project is to collect user feedback in a structured way (setup experience, usability, failure modes). We are therefore looking for volunteers who are willing to test the extension before Project Week and during the event. Testers will be asked to follow a short setup and usage checklist and report what works, what breaks, and what is confusing. Feedback will be used to iteratively improve and finalize the extension during Project Week.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Finalize a stable version of the extension compatible with current 3D Slicer.
2. Collect actionable user feedback from multiple testers and implement it during Project Week.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Move the extension into the original repository 
2. Fix open bugs, cleanup and restructure implementation 
3. Implement setup experience (detect Docker availability)
4. Provide a full step-by-step tutorial using the extension
5. Find voluntary testers (possibly before the start of PW) 
6. Collect actionable user feedback from multiple testers before and during PW.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
