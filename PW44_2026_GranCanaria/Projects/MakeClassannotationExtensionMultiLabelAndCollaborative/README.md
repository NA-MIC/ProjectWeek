# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


ClassAnnotation is an extension designed to support users during medical image annotation process and it is able to generate a structured output for AI applications. Currently, the system does not support multiple label per patient; therefore, it's desiderable to implement a Multi-Label module to enable this feature. We would also to investigate an approach to make the annotation task collaborative.




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Create Multi-Label module
2. Try to implement a prototype for collaborative annotation



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Gather feedback about ClassAnnotation
2. Create Multi-Label module 
3. Discuss about the implementation of a collaboration between annotators



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Extended ClassAnnotation from single-label to multi-label allowing multiple features per patient (still working in progress).
2. Added a clear multi-label user interface with automatically generated class buttons and consistent Single/Multi mode behavior.
3. Defined a structured multi-label output.
4. Talked to Andras and got some good advice from him.

Next Steps

- Perform thorough testing and validation of the multi-label mode.
- Add support for a collaborative configuration.
