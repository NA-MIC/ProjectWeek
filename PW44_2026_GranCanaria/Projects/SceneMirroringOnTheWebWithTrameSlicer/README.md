# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Following our success in bringing core 3D Slicer functionalities on the web with the trame framework, we are continuing our endeavor by adding more connectivity between the Slicer application and the trame ecosystem.

This project will bring a connection between the Slicer application scene and the trame application providing a stepping stone for exciting new features such as:
- Real time review and cooperation in one viewer
- Remote IGT display on tablets or light devices
- Interactive teaching modules
- ...




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. New module / logic dedicated to starting a trame server in the main thread
2. Library components for users to define their own mirroring
3. Example on linking the trame-slicer Segmentation application with the Slicer main application





## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Proof of concept of starting a trame server in the Slicer application thread
2. Test of putting trame components into the Qt layout using QWebEngine components
3. Implementation / test of scene interactive linking between Slicer and trame Slicer
4. Bi directional interaction on the same Scene and interactivity tests



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
