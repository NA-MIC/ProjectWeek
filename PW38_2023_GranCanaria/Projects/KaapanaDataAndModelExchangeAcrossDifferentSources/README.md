# Project Description

Implementations and discussion about a standardized data and model exchange between different platforms such as Kaapana and MONAI. Working on integrating Kaapana with other toolkits.
- Motivation: Running Kaapana platforms in multiple (inter-)national projects: RACOON, DART, ...
- Goal: Standarized and Federated Data Analysis / Federated Learning require standardized model exchange formats

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Support standardized data and AI model I/O interfaces in Kaapana.

1. Support of various AI model sources
- Integration of MONAI Model Zoo into Kaapana
     - inference pipeline as a Kaapana workflow / as a Kaapana extension
     - training pipeline
     - generic support of MONAI Bundles (MONAI Label / MONAI Deploy / MONAI FL)
- Standardized remote model execution, execution of models from modelhub.ai within Kaapana
2. Integration/support of data sources:
- TCIA download/(upload) into Kaapana 
- Integration with IDC: download of data via Google Cloud SDK
3. Integration of new analysis tools into Kaapana
4. Javascript/Python library client to communicate with Kaapana

- Integration of MONAI Model Zoo into Kaapana
     - inference pipeline as a Kaapana workflow / as a Kaapana extension
     - training pipeline

2. Integration/support of data sources:
- TCIA download/(upload) into Kaapana
     - Kaapana workflow to download specific TCIA datasets
     - select to-be-downloaded dataset via UI
     - send downloaded dataset to Kaapana's PACS

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Support of various AI model sources
- Integration of MONAI Model Zoo into Kaapana
     - Proof of concept: Intgration of MONAI Model Zoos spleen CT segmentation works
     - tbd: Finalize integration in Kaapana
- Support of MHub
     - 

2. Integration/support of data sources:
- TCIA download/(upload) into Kaapana
     - Implemented `service-tcia-download`. Now it is possible to drag and drop a .tcia manifest file into Kaapana (in minio). This will start a workflow which                downloads the data from TCIA via their REST-API. Number of workers can be set in the operator.
