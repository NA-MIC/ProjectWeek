# Project Description

Implementations and discussion about a standardized data and model exchange between different platforms such as Kaapana and MONAI. Working on integrating Kaapana with other toolkits.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Integration/support of data sources:
- TCIA download/(upload) into Kaapana 
- Integration with IDC: download of data via Google Cloud SDK
2. Support of various AI model sources
- Standardized remote model execution, execution of models from modelhub.ai within Kaapana
- Kaapana with MONAI Label/ MONAI Bundle within Kaapana
3. Integration of new analysis tools into Kaapana
4. Javascript/Python library client to communicate with Kaapana
