# Breakout Session: Anatomy Atlases and Atlas Development

## Key Investigators

- Michael Halle
- the atlas development community

# Session Description

This breakout session about atlases is designed to allow members of our community to
discuss the work they are doing to create atlases and use them in different applications. 
We will also discuss new technologies in 3D Slicer that may be useful to atlas developers, 
as well as challenges that the community may face. 

Please share the work that you are doing, and how you are using atlases!

Atlases are datasets that serve as references, standards, examples, or teaching tools. 
Recently, there has been an exciting growth in the development of new anatomic and 
biomedical atlases. The availability of 3D Slicer has helped enable this growth. Today,
technologies using machine learning and automatic segmentation offer new opportunities 
for atlas creation and use. The OpenAnatomy project at Brigham and Women's Hospital 
is working to create a community dedicated to the creation of high quality 
anatomical atlases. 

For this session, we are scheduled to be joined by Anatomist Paul Neumann, the current 
editor of Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy and a partner with the OpenAnatomy Project in the
creation of TA2Viewer (https://ta2viewer.openanatomy.org).

We also hope to be joined by members of the UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center and the [Amara Yad](https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/heart/arrhythmia/about-us/amara-yad-project) 
project, who are developing open atlases based on a particularly noble cause. Their first 
atlas, is an open access cardiac atlas: [Atlas of Cardiac Anatomy Vol. 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yvaYaKXc517YzPWJL474dS_FlLH4_Cwe/view).

## Rough schedule:

- Community presentations about atlas development (please contribute!)
- New and in-development features in 3D Slicer
  - Machine learning tools (TotalSegmentator, SynthSeg...)
  - VTK SurfaceNets multi-object surface creation (in development)
- Shared Challenges
  - Terminology (how to label atlas objects)
  - Sharing and distribution of atlases - OpenAnatomy exporter
  - Building a community of atlas creators and users
