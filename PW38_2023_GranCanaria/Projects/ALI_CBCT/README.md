# Project Description

We propose a novel approach that reformulates anatomical landmark detection as a classification problem through a virtual agent placed inside a 3D Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. This agent is trained to navigate in a multi-scale volumetric space to reach the estimated landmark position. The agent movements decision relies on a combination of Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DCCN) and fully connected layers.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Retrain the different models with new data 
1. Do some maintenance on the previously made code

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Use the available code to train with additional patient data for each landmarks

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. ALI models are currently being retrained with new data
