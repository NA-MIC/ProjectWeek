# Project Description

Open source technologies have opened up a world of possibilities for the development of clinical simulation centers and virtual hospitals. This project aims to explore how these technologies can be used to create innovative projects in the healthcare sector. We will discuss how open source technologies can support virtual hospitals and simulation centers, and how this could benefit both patients and healthcare providers. We will also look at the potential use cases of such projects, their impact on patient care, and their potential cost savings. Finally, we will discuss the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make these projects successful.

## Objectives

1. To identifiy which tecnology and computer-based applications can be usefull for the partner's simulation centers.
2. To know the profile of trainees for each simulation center.
3. To identify how to improve the simulation resources that we currently have.
4. To take into account the training needs.

## Approach and Plan

1. We created a work team to discuss the objetives.
2.
