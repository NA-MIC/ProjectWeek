# Project Description

The aim of the projet is to make a initial implementation of a conventional nuclear medicine application in OHIF. This will be a DATSCAN viewer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioflupane_(123I))
This implementation will allow us to identify the key issues that are needed to be solved to use OHIF as a framework to develop nuclear medicine applications in the future (more than 20 applications made in Fiji should be ported to OHIF in a long term roadmap).

## Objective

1. Vizualisation of DATSCAN, using the ongoing multiframe support of OHIF
- Dedicated HP
- Image reorientation
- Custom LUT
2. Programatically set predifined ROI in the volume (can use TMTV extension)
3. Basic quantification insides the ROIs (mean, max)

## Approach and Plan

An anonymized DATSCAN image will be provided for developpement.
Public repository for contributors.

## Progress and Next Steps

Report of keys issues to solve in OHIF for further nuclear medicine applications developpement.
