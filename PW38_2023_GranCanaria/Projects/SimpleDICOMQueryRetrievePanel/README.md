# Project Description

Implement a Query/Retrieve panel for DICOM databases.

## Objective

Have a simple user-friendly interface to query/retrieve from a DICOM server.
The user interface would render series thumbnails so the users can easily navigate the DICOM database
(see illustrations for a first UI Design prototype).
Moreover, perfomance needs to be boosted as much as possible: 

1) fetch metadata only when strictly required (e.g. get series metadata only when the user clicks and opens a study item of the list)

2) the fetch should be performed in async with Qthreads/workers and parallelized.


## Approach and Plan

1) Get feedback

2) Design the solution

3) Start implementation

## Progress and Next Steps
