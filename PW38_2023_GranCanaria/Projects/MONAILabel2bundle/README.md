# Project Description

MONAI Label has become a very popular tool in the NA-MIC community for developing new trained models and incorporating expert feedback into the training process.

Unfortunately, it is currently not straightforward to take the models trained using MONAI Label and apply them in batch mode.

MONAI supports bundles, which are designed for batch mode processing, but the process of converting MONAI Label trained networks into MONAI bundle representation is not well understood and (per MONAI experts) currently requires support from MONAI developers.

In this project we want to explore the process of converting MONAI Label trained networks into MONAI bundle format, and demonstrate how the resulting bundles can be applied to datasets in [NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/).

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Develop a complete example transforming MONAI Label network to MONAI bundle.
1. Improve existing documentation.
1. Demonstrate how MONAI Label trained network converted to bundle can be applied to a representative sample of data from IDC.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Use MONAI Label trained model for [segmentation of vertebrae in CT](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/blob/main/sample-apps/radiology/main.py#L174) as the use case. 
2. Identify MONAI documentation for transforming MONAI Label trained network into MONAI bundle format.
3. Develop MONAI bundle from the network in 1.
4. Select applicable representative subset of data from IDC and apply resulting bundle to a produce segmentations, save segmentations as DICOM SEG, confirm visualization with OHIF.
5. Document the process and any refinements to the existing instructions.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Identified MONAI Label network location; discussed the project with Stephen, identified relevant expertise on MONAI side; planning to have coordination meeting with Roya.
1. Identified from Andres an example of a [MONAI Label app](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/blob/main/sample-apps/radiology/lib/configs/deepedit.py) and the corresponding [MONAI bundle](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_deepedit_annotation/configs). 
1. Identified another possible example of a [MONAI Label app](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/blob/main/sample-apps/radiology/lib/configs/segmentation_spleen.py) and the corresponding [MONAI bundle](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation/configs). 
1. In progress [colab notebook](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-vertebrae-ct-segmentation/blob/main/MONAI_spine_localization_task.ipynb) for the conversion of spine localization task
1. Discussion with Jesse, Andres, Stephen, Steve: Look into creating a bundle vs MONAI deploy app SDK. We started a public discussion of MONAI label app to bundle creation [here](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/discussions/5894#discussioncomment-4769712)
1. Yesterday during the MONAILabel AWS workshop, we tried out the localization_spine step. It seemed to work on the dataset, but we noticed that the model was both named differently and in a different app folder. We wanted to make sure that we could also perform the localization_spine successfully either in Slicer or in a script. We started with the scripted version [here](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/blob/main/sample-apps/radiology/main.py), on a nifti file from VERSE, which was also used for training. We expected this to produce a somewhat reasonable segmentation of the spine, but it produced an empty segment. We tried the second stage of localization_vertebra model, and this produced a partial segmentation of one vertebra. 
1. We then explored into setting up MONAILabel locally. We managed to install everything and start the server on Windows (Mac is a WIP), and ran inference using the localization_spine model through Slicer on a nifti file from the training data in VERSE. This again yielded empty segments...
1. We found a post in the [Slicer discourse forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/monailabel-vertebrae-segmentation-sample-app-doesnt-work-for-sample-data/27243) where others also had problems with the vertebrae_pipeline. However, this doesn't completely address our problem as this one uses a network trained on TotalSegmentator data to perform segmentation of organs+vertebrae. Though the segmentations might be acceptable, this might not work for all as there is no preservation of the ordering of the vertebrae, which might be better addressed by the 3 stage vertebra_pipeline (localization_spine, localization_vertebra, vertebra_segmentation). 
1. We will talk to Nazim tomorrow to see if he has encountered issues using the localization_spine step on data that it was trained on. In the meantime, we will try out the updated model provided by Andres for vertebra segmentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17eJan-8_oNCnZyJk8B9zLQpwaOjtDuKi?usp=share_link) to make sure we can at least get results with this in Slicer. Perhaps we can convert this to a bundle first? --> As a test, this model worked on a dataset from the training set of TotalSegmentator,and also worked on a dataset from VERSE, with expected differences in segmentation accuracy because of resolution etc. 
1. Cosmin and I met with Nazim to talk about our issues with the localization_spine step in Slicer producing empty labels. We tried running all three stages and got a runtime error - tensor shape. We then tried the segmentation_spleen model on training data from Task09_Spleen, this should produce a proper spleen label. It did not, kind of a fragmented spleen. Is this a CPU vs GPU problem? Cosmin will try to test on his Linux machine that has a GPU. Do we have the lastest versions of the pretrained models? The spleen model is coming from [here](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/releases/download/pretrained/radiology_segmentation_unet_spleen.pt) which is the most recent one. Nazim suggested trying to install everything again. I will also try segmentation_spleen model using a script. 
1. I posted on Slicer discourse about some issues with MONAI Label and the 3 stage vertebra segmentation pipeline. https://discourse.slicer.org/t/using-monailabel-for-vertebrae-segmentation/27511 

1. We tried installing the latest preview release of Slicer to see if inference worked with localization_spine on 2019 and 2020 VERSE dataset, it did not. We also tried the whole vertebrae pipeline and we have the same error with tensor shape size - RuntimeError: Expected 4D or 5D (batch mode) tensor with possibly 0 batch size and other non-zero dimensions for input, but got: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Umang - also where is the temp file saved for the first localization_spine step?
2. In the meantime we will try converting the full CT seg (trained using TotalSegmentator data) to a bundle. If that works we can go back to the vertebra pipeline? Steve suggested also that we do this instead of focusing on the vertebra. And maybe if we want to train the full CT with higher resolution data (change the target_spacing is the main thing we need to do?) we could think about this at a later stage.
