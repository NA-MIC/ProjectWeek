# Project Description

A three-dimensional visualization of dento-alveolar structures can enhance the surgical planning process. However, no fully automated segmentation methods are currently available to generate realistic 3D virtual models of teeth and alveolar bone.

We have a dataset of 43 CBCT scans with manual segmentation of teeth and alveolar bone.

We have already tested segmentation and deepedit models in MONAI Label. Those models are good for single label teeth segmentation or mandible segmentation. However, results are not optimal when trying to perform a multi-label segmentation where all teeth are correctly identified and segmented.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Implement multi-stage approach for teeth segmentation using MONAI Label pipelines. At least, two stages: (1) teeth localization and (2) teeth segmentation.
