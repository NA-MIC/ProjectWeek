# Project Description

The aim of the project is to develop a training system that provides a quantitative report regarding the use of a low-cost lung phantom [1] in ultrasound-guided interventions, particularly for core needle biopsy (CNB). 

A phantom with several embedded solid inclusions was fabricated. These inclusions are colour coded thus, a qualitative report can be used to indicate the success
of a CNB procedure. However, a quantitative analysis is required. For this reason, the development of a training system is planned.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Fabrication of dedicated phantom 
2. Objective B. Setting up the system's tools 
3. Objective C. Application development

## Approach and Plan

1. Phantom model --> Accurately replicated thoracic tissues (lung, ribs, and solid masses) providing a useful tool for training US-guided procedures
2. Tools connections via Optitrack and Plus Toolkit (Telemed/Clarius system and needle for biopsy) 
4. Application development

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Fabrication of dedicated phantom --> Virtual and recontructed model finished  
2. Design of tracking fixtures for the required equipment --> Biopsy needle (Bard 22mm), Telemed MicrUs EXT-1H L12 Probe. Extra tools and some adjustments to be implemented 
3. 3D Models of the equipments --> Biopsy needle (loaded and extended) and Telemed US system
4. Optitrack + US System setup --> Connection to SLICER via Plus Toolkit using Telemed US System. Issues to connect the Clarius US system to be solved
5. Preliminar tracking system working --> New calibrations to be performed after upgrading the fixtures
6. Extension implementation pending
