# Fast viewing and tagging of DICOM Images

## Key Investigators

- Stefan Denner (German Cancer Research Center, Germany)
- Klaus Kades (German Cancer Research Center, Germany)

# Project Description

Creating a cohort or tagging DICOM images can be very time-consuming. In this project, we are working on solutions to faciliate the process.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Improving the Gallery view in Kaapana in cooperation with other participants
2. Intecreating native DICOM image support into the annotation tool [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)
3. Discussion: DICOM Dashboard Setup (somewhat) related to this: in IDC we have been using Google DataStudio / Looker, and Apache Superset (to a lesser degree) - can discuss

Relate to:
- [Kaapana overall](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/Kaapana_overall)
