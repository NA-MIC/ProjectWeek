# Project Description

It could be useful for Desktop applications such as 3D slicer or MITK to run within a browser, for this a containerization of the application is necessary. Also it could be useful for Desktop applications to communicate with third-party endpoints to, for examples, run a model on images to get a segmentation. In this project, we focus on solution to containerize desktop applications and on communicating with third-party tools

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Desktop apps in containers (Slicer, MITK, OHIF, …), Improved Slicer integration
2. Desktop interaction with Kaapana (Slicer, MITK, ITK-SNAP …)

Relate to:
- [Kaapana overall](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/Kaapana_overall)
- [SlicerCloud](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/SlicerCloud)
- [OHIFSlicerBridge](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/blob/master/PW33_2020_GranCanaria/Projects/OHIFSlicerBridge/README.md)


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Look at the current state of Slicer and MITK integration in Kaapana (container and client/server interaction)

2. Finish/adapt integration.
3. Improve desktop (running in a browser) streaming solutions - (noVNC, guacamole...) in the Kaapana kubernetes cluster. 
4. Create documented API for an interaction Kaapana with destop clients

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Integrated Slicer extension
1. Startet workflow "Slicer-flow"
1. Created uniform Kaapana RestApi for dicomweb
