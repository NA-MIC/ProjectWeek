# Project Description

It could be useful for Desktop applications such as 3D slicer or MITK to run within a browser, for this a containerization of the application is necessary. Also it could be useful for Desktop applications to communicate with third-party endpoints to, for examples, run a model on images to get a segmentation. In this project, we focus on solution to containerize desktop applications and on communicating with third-party tools

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Desktop apps in containers (Slicer, MITK, OHIF, …), Improved Slicer integration
2. Desktop interaction with Kaapana (Slicer, MITK, ITK-SNAP …)
