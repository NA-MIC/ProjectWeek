# Project Description

Symptoms of long-COVID19 might linger for several weeks or months after the initial infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptoms are headache, problems with memory and concentration, anxiety, extreme fatigue, chest pain or tightness, gastrointestinal symptoms and difficulty sleeping. In addition, abnormal immune response to viral infection is reported in patients with long-COVID. A dysfunctional brainstem might explain the neuropsychiatric, and autonomic symptoms as a consequence of abnormal immune response. 

## Objective

<!--  . -->

1. Are long-COVID symptoms associated with changes in white matter fiber tracts of the brainstem? .
1. Objective B. ...
1. Objective C. ...

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Segment ROIs in the brainstem.
2. Delineate white matter tracts of the brainstem in a postmortem dMRI data set (50 micro m resolution) and in a 3T dataset of a patient with long-COVID. Candidate tracts are Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB) and Dorsal Longitudinal Fiber (DLF) and other fiber tracts of the brainstem.
3. Brainstorm hypotheses about which symptoms of long-COVID might be associated with individual tracts of the brainstem.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Segmentation of the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (solitary complex)–Area Postrema (NTS-AP). 
NTS-AP plays an impotant role in neuro-immune regulatory loops and autonomic reflexes. 

2. Delineated the Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB) and Dorsal Longitudinal Fiber (DLF) within the brainstem in the postmortem dMRI data set.
3. Run whole brain tractography on the 3T data set.
4. Registering the 3T data set to the postmortem dMRI data set.
