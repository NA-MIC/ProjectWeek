# Project Description

We are aiming to combine a few existing 3D Slicer modules into a single easy-to-use module that allows the verification of a given registration with the underlying, fully known displacement field. This will give researchers the ability to test the efficacy of different registration algorithms, different image resolutions and different gradient configurations.

This will be achieved by analytically describing a displacement field and warping a set of images with that field using the Scattered Transform module. This pair of images can the be used to test and verify the accuracy of any registration algorithm within the Slicer environment. Accuracy of the registration could be reported on globally, at specific points or even on segmented strucutures within the images!

## Objective

1. Generate global numeric comparision metrics between two transforms in 3D Slicer.
1. Combine Scattered Transform and the General Registration (elastix) modules into one custom 3D Slicer module.
1. Add comparison metric from Step 1 into custom module.
1. Add ability to report comparison metric on segmented strucutures within the image.
