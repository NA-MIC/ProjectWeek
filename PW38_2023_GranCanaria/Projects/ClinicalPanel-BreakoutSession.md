# Panel: clinical uses of 3D Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Rudolf Bumm
- Alexandra Golby
- Babacar Diao
- Ron Alkalay
- Lucia Cevidanes
- Andras Lasso

# Session Description

This panel will gather clinicians to discuss how do they use 3D Slicer in their practice. The panel will be moderated by Rudolf Bumm. The goal is to provide feedback and answer questions from the community, both from engineers interested in the point of view of clinicians and from other clinians interested in the possibilities of Slicer. Here's a tentative list of suggested topics discussed during preparation meetings:
- How do clinicians anonymize, annotate and share data? (Rudolf)
- How to test the effectiveness of Slicer-based tools in the clinic? (Lucia)
- Collaborators in Africa use Slicer atlases for training, but would like to move to intervention. There is a big gap, how to fill it? (Gabor) 
- Slicer can be used to 1) build very specific applications with lots of constraints or 2) by curious clinicians to start doing research based on annotating and measuring on imaging. (Alexandra G.)
- What can we do to make Slicer more conformant with existing commercial clinical and radiologic tools? (Andras)
