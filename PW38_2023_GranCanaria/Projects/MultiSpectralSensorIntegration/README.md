# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Integration of a predefined set of sensors in the 3D Slicer platform,  via Plus Toolkit  and OpenIGTLink, for future use in clinical applications.
Several sensors/cameras operating in different electromagnetic ranges and using different communication standards (USB, CameraLink, GigE, GenICam) will be integrated.
The set of cameras to integrate includes (but not limited to): visible light USB cameras, PCO (ultraviolet, USB, several models), Thermal Expert (infrared, USB/CameraLink, several models), FLIR (infrared, GigE, several models), Specim (hyperspectral, GenICam, several models).


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Adding selected sensors as new devices in PTK.
1. Visualization and control of integrated sensors from Slicer.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Integration of at least one USB camera (sensor) as a  PTK device.
1. Integration of at least one CameraLink sensor as a  PTK device.
1. Integration of at least one GigE sensor as a PTK device.
1. Integration of at least one GenICam sensor as a PTK device.
