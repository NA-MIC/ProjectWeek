# Project Description

In order to meet the demand for professionals in the field of computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions, universities need to set up courses that provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills. Designing a university course on this topic requires careful consideration of the syllabus and design materials that will be used. This project will explore how universities can create a syllabus and design material for a course on computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions using open source technology. 

## Objective

1. Define the topics that should be covered in the syllabus 
1. Select learning resources and bibliography to support the course contents 
1. Design materials to be used in the lessons based on open source technologies 
1. Develop common contents to facilitate exchange of personnel and students from different countries 

## Approach and Plan

1. Explore the competences that are required in the professional market to define the course content
1. Discuss with the 3D Slicer community how to create materials based on open source technology and integrate them on a syllabus
1. Propose a biomedical engineering course program

## Progress and Next Steps

We have designed the following syllabus proposal: 

**Computer Assisted Medical Imaging and Interventions (60 hours – 6 ECTS)**

An introductory course that uses 3D Slicer to demonstrate all the necessary concepts.

- 40 hours (4 ECTS) to introduce all the main concepts along with practical demos using the well-known medical image computing open software ecosystem 3D Slicer split into 10 subjects, each one to be taught in two classes of two hours.
  - Subject 1 provides a general introduction to medical images
  - Subjects 2 trough 9 use Slicer Notebooks on Jupyter Lab
  - Subject 10 develops an introductory application using Slicer

- 20 hours (2 ECTS) to develop a practical use-case on 3D Slicer as a self-contained application. Projects offered: 
  - Creating a Virtual Reality application in Slicer
  - Integration of a deep learning model to segment medical images
  - Developing a module for image guided therapy (IGT)
