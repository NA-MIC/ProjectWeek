# Project Description

In order to meet the demand for professionals in the field of computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions, universities need to set up courses that provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills. Designing a university course on this topic requires careful consideration of the syllabus and design materials that will be used. This project will explore how universities can create a syllabus and design material for a course on computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions using open source technology.
