# Project Description

In order to meet the demand for professionals in the field of computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions, universities need to set up courses that provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills. Designing a university course on this topic requires careful consideration of the syllabus and design materials that will be used. This project will explore how universities can create a syllabus and design material for a course on computer assisted medical imaging, manufacturing and interventions using open source technology. 

## Objective

1. Define the topics that should be covered in the syllabus.
1. Select learning resources and bibliography to create the course contents.
1. Design materials to be used in the lessons based on open source technologies.

## Approach and Plan

1. Explore the competences that are required in the professional market to define the contents of the course.
1. Discuss with the 3D Slicer community how to create materials based on open sourge technology and integrate them on a syllabus.
1. Develop a tutorial module in 3D Slicer to learn the basic use of the software. This module will be designed to provide a quick and easy way of information for beginners to get used to the environment.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
