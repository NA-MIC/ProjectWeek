# Project Description

**“Metadata is a love note to the future”**

Jason Scott

The [Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en) is a cross-domain initiative across the whole Helmholtz Association, which is the largest funding agency in Germany. It follows the goal to develop and establish novel methods and tools documenting and sharing research data by means of enriched metadata, as well as improved interoperability of data across disciplines. The Hub Health of this initiative is anchored in the Division of Medical Image Computing at the German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg.

The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) are guidelines to make your data, including software, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. They are an important component of Open Science.

[NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons) is tasked with establishing publicly available repository of cancer imaging data, and in this role is developing workflows to harmonize image and image-derived data representation into DICOM, make metadata searchable, and connect imaging metadata with clinical metadata. Thus, this project might be helpful to the HMC project. We will explore this connection this week!

We will investigate relevant metadata descriptions of medical images, cohorts, and medical image analyis pipelines and results like machine learning models.

An additional aspect to look at will be aspects of generating, reviewing and sharing of metadata of research data which contains personally identifiable information.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Common standards, tools and practices can make interoperability much easier. Within this project we want to investigate which tools are already used in our community, which lessons were already learned, and perform experiments regarding interoperability of data and analysis pipelines as well as analysis results.

1. Objective A. Create an overview on existing tools and standards
2. Objective B. Identify challenges.
3. Objective C. Perform interoperability experiments

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Have a walkthrough of the IDC project and tech stack - starting from this introductory tutorial series in IDC: [https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started)

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
