# FAIRification of medical imaging data and analysis tools

## Key Investigators

- Marco Nolden (German Cancer Research Center, Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration, Germany)
- Andrey Fedorov (Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, USA)

# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) are guidelines to make your data, including software, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. They are an important component of Open Science.

The [Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en) follows the goal to develop and establish novel methods and tools documenting data by means of enriched metadata.

[NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons) is tasked with establishing publicly available repository of cancer imaging data, and in this role is developing workflows to harmonize image and image-derived data representation into DICOM, make metadata searchable, and connect imaging metadata with clinical metadata. Thus, this project might be helpful to the HMC project. We will explore this connection this week!


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Common standards, tools and practices can make interoperability much easier. Within this project we want to investigate which tools are already used in our community, which lessons were already learned, and perform experiments regarding interoperability of data and analysis pipelines as well as analysis results.

1. Objective A. Create an overview on existing tools and standards
2. Objective B. Identify challenges.
3. Objective C. Perform interoperability experiments
