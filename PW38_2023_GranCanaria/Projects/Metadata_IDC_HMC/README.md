# FAIRification of medical imaging data and analysis tools

## Key Investigators

- Marco Nolden (German Cancer Research Center, Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration, Germany)
- Andrey Fedorov (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, USA)

# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) are guidelines to make your data, including software, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. They are an important component of Open Science.

The [Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en) follows the goal to develop and establish novel methods and tools documenting data by means of enriched metadata.

[Imaging Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons) is a relevant project in this space.
 


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Common standards, tools and practices can make interoperability much easier. Within this project we want to investigate which tools are already used in our community, which lessons were already learned, and perform experiments regarding interoperability of data and analysis pipelines as well as analysis results.

1. Objective A. Create an overview on existing tools and standards
2. Objective B. Identify challenges.
3. Objective C. Perform interoperability experiments
