# Project Description

This is a follow-up to previous 3D Slicer lung CT segmentation PW projects. 

## Objective

Our objective is to improve the lung CT segmentation and analysis processes in 3D Slicer.

*   Improve **vessel** segmentation
*   Implement **emphysema** and COPD analysis
*   Develop a concept for **lung segment** segmentation in 3D Slicer
*   Fine-tune the workflow for **surgical planning**
*   Work on possible **grant application**

## Specific Approach and Plan

*   make lung, lobe, and airway segmentation fully automatic (no manual intervention)
*   write a batch script that makes use of the LCTA logic
*   test the script on the OpenSourceCovidDatabase
*   evaluate results and compare them to radiology score 
*   discuss strategies for vessel segmentation and segment detection
