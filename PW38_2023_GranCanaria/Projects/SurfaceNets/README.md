# Project Description

The project will implement Sarah F. Frisken's Surface Net C++ algorithm as a 3D Slicer extension. This algorithm is used to generate conforming surface meshes from segmented 3D (multi) labelled medical images.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Implement the base Surface Nets C++ alogirthm as an extension with user adjustable surface fairing parameters.
2. Objective B. Extend the extension to allow users to select/deselect which labels to include/remove.
3. Objective C. ...

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Learn the basics of implementing a 3D Slicer extension.
2. Implement algorithm.
3. Extend functionality.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. The algorithm itself has been released by Sarah Frisken in C++ langauge. 
2. Next step is to implement!
3. ...
