# Project Description

With the help of 3D Slicer and open source software, anatomy atlases and training tools are becoming more accessible than ever. These tools allow medical professionals to gain a better understanding of the human body, from its organs and muscles to its bones and tissues. They also provide an opportunity for medical students to practice their skills in a virtual environment without risking any harm to real patients.

This project aims to provide a the tools and knowledge for generating a comprehensive set of atlasses. Additionally, it will enable the development of innovative tools such as augmented reality (AR) applications and virtual reality (VR) simulations to further enhance the learning experience.
