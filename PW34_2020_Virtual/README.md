## Welcome to the web page for the 34th Project Week!

The [34th NA-MIC Project Week](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/) will be held virtually December 14-18, 2020.

The event is free and connection details will be provided after [registering](https://forms.gle/VFTNfKRNsgj6YSLB9).

Please read about our experience in running these events since 2005: [Increasing the Impact of Medical Image Computing Using
Community-Based Open-Access Hackathons: the NA-MIC and 3D Slicer Experience](http://perk.cs.queensu.ca/sites/perkd7.cs.queensu.ca/files/Kapur2016.pdf).

## Format

The format of this virtual event will be different from the in-person ones.  We will meet daily for 2 hours instead of full days:
* Monday's session will include short project presentations in the form of 5-minute demos or talks.  All demos will be pre-recorded for efficiency.
* Tuesday's session will be a discussion about features in 3D Slicer that are new since the last Project Week, and also on design considerations that are relevant for end-to-end solutions (or customizable Slicer apps).
* Wednesday's session will be a question and answer session about 3D Slicer, a "live" version of what takes place asynchronously on the Slicer discourse forum, and will include demostrations of how to use the Segmentation Editor in 3D Slicer.
* Thursday's session will be a discussion on recent advancing in the web and cloud technologies that are being used to create browser based visualization applications and large open databases.
* Friday's session will be a training workshop focused on fostering partnerships with researchers and clinicians in Western Africa.
