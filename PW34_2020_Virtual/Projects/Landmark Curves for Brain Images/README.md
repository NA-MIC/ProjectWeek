# Project Description

The overaching goal of this project is to facilitate the assignment of cerebral cortical areas borders in MRI images by developing a tool and technique for drawing on the surface representation of the human cerebral cortex. Since delineation of different brain areas are often performed by using the depths of cortical sulci as borders (i.e., anatomical landmarks), a semiautomated means to reliably create these borders on different views of the brain would enable fast, reliable and easy parcellation of brain areas.
## Objective

The overall objective today is to demonstrate a tool and technique to produce curves on a surface representation of the cerebral cortex.
