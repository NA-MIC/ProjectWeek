# TRAKO Integration to 3D Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Daniel Haehn (University of Massachusetts Boston)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics)

# Project Description

TRAKO is a new file format that stores streamlines and associated per-vertex and per-fiber data as glTF containers with compression. We will investigate how to best integrate TRAKO with 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

We want to make it possible to read and write TRAKO (.TKO) files using 3D Slicer.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Integrate TRAKO with the MRML scene architecture.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
