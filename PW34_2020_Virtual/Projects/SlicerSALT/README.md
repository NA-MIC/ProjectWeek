# Project Description

Three-dimensional (3D) shape lies at the core of understanding the physical objects that surround us. In the biomedical field, shape analysis has been shown to be powerful in quantifying how anatomy changes with time and disease. The Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SALT, funded under the project R01EB021391) was created as a vehicle for disseminating advanced shape methodology as an open source, free, and comprehensive software tool. Over the past four years, we have made strides to increase the ease of use of complex shape analysis methodology for biomedical researchers. We used 3DSlicer as a basis to create SlicerSALT, fostering strong user support and engagement with the research community in training events. By looking at the active number of users of SlicerSALT, we can confidently say that we have succeeded, as indicated by the following metrics: the SALT website has 7,044-page views from 2,913 unique users. Our software packages have been downloaded 1,836 times by 719 single users. Since 2017, our user forum has 50 posts and 202 replies with a total of 21,526 views.

## Objective

During this project week we would like to present the latest upgrades introduced into SlicerSALT 3.0 and our plans to improve it in our next funding period.ined in our shape models is challenging to interpret. To solve this, we will develop and integrate easy to interpret, statistical methods to better leverage the quantitative information contained in our models. Second, we will improve the usability of SALT by facilitating the analysis of large-scale data sets and automate workflows for non-expert users.
