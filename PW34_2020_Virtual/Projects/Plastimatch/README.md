# Project Description

Plastimatch is a registration and image processing software that runs either standalone or as a Slicer extension within SlicerRT.
Over the past several years, there have been improvements in plastimatch that have not been migrated to 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Upgrade plastimatch version used by SlicerRT.
1. Add capability to run plastimatch executable from python.
1. Add capability for free-form command file editing.

If time allows

1. Add interface from 3D Slicer to surface-based registration (dmap-dmap and point-dmap).

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. This is pretty straightforward stuff, just takes time to achieve.
