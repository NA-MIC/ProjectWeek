# Project Description

The goal of this project is to extend 3D Slicer with tools to help biologists working with 3D specimen data. The SlicerMorph toolkit enables biologists to retrieve, visualize, measure, annotate, and perform geometric morphometric analyses from high-resolution specimen data both from volumetric scans (CTs and MRs) as well as from 3D surface scanners effectively within 3D Slicer.

## Objective

During project week we would like to show a demo of the SlicerMorph extension and connect with other developers who are working on similar projects.

1. Demonstrate the newest functions added to SlicerMorph
2. Identify developers who share goals and interests
3. Discuss areas of commonality and future work

## Approach and Plan

1. Short demo of SlicerMorph
2. Schedule a longer discussion if there is interest

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
