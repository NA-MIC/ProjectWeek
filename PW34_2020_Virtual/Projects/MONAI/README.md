# Project Description

MONAI is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based, [open-source](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/master/LICENSE) framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).
Its ambitions are:
- developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- providing researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Introduce Monai
1. Datasets and DataLoaders for participating in Challenges and using pubic data collections
1. Transforms for data pre-processing and augmentation
1. Participating in a deep learning challenge in 10 lines of python
1. Integration into clinical workflows: MONAI + Nvidia CLARA
1. Ongoing efforts: Model Zoo

## Approach and Plan

1. Present MONAI
1. Advertise resources for support and training (including resources for hackathons / datathons)

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. 5-minute presentation on Monday
1. 1 hours presentation on Wednesday
