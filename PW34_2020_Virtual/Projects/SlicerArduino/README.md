# Project Description

SlicerArduino is a Slicer Extension for connecting Arduino (and Arduino-like) boards to Slicer.
In this way it is possible to easily acquire/send data from/to the external environment.

A [journal paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/7/3/109) about SlicerArduino has been already publised

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Show how SlicerArduino works.
1. Objective B.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Explain the desing of the extension.
1. Show two different use cases.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Collect as much as possible suggestions and comments.
