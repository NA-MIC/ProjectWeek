# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This work is part of an NIH Trailblazer R21 grant to our team to develop and validate computational methods for quantifying pulmonary congestion using B-lines in heart failure patients from bedside lung ultrasound in emergency settings. Tools for automated quantification could help emergency department physicians more rapidly and frequently examine patients to assess progress and adjust treatment, resulting in improved care and patient outcomes.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Add a new public module for annotation of pulmonary congestion in ultrasound
2. Add new feature to existing public Anonymizer module: AI-assisted detection of image fan boundaries in ultrasound to streamline anonymization, followed by OCR in output which produces warning if any text is detected in image



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


We will spend Project Week developing the software to support these features and hopefully release the modules publicly.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
