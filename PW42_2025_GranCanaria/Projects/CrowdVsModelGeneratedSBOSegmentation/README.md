# Project Description

Abdominal ultrasound images were given to a crowd of novice labelers using the Centaur platform to segment the bowel to assist in diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.
We will compare the accuracy of these crowd sourced labels to those generated by a model, prompted by a segmentation on one frame of a clip.
