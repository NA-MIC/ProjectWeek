# Project Description

Abdominal ultrasound images were given to a crowd of novice labelers using the Centaur platform to segment the bowel to assist in diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.
We will compare the accuracy of these crowd sourced labels to those generated by a model, prompted by a segmentation on one frame of a clip.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Implement MultiverSeg for predictions on abdominal ultrasound images.
1. Objective B. Evaluate the number of context frames and user interactions needed to achieve the same accuracy as a consensus of non-expert labelers and expert labelers.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Using a set of ultrasound images (which were annotated by a crowd of non-expert labelers and validated by an expert physician) with segmentations of small bowel on every 4th frame, prompt the model using 1+ context frames and an increasing number of user interactions. Using a dice score, evaluate the difference between the model predictions and crowd consensus in segmenting small bowel. Similarly, compare the model results to segmentations performed by expert physicians.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
