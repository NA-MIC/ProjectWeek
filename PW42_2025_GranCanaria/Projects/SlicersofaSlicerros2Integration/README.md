# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


licerSOFA and SlicerROS2 are two 3D Slicer extensions that bridge mechanical simulations and robotic applications with 3D Slicer. Their recent addition to the 3D Slicer ecosystem opens up new possibilities for developing robotic applications that simulate interactions with medical environments.

In this project, we aim to create a proof-of-concept integration where a Phantom Omni, controlled by SlicerROS2, interacts with a soft organ through SlicerSOFA. We will examine and discuss aspects such as the interface between ROS and SOFA, as well as performance considerations, to guide the future development of robotic applications that integrate simulated environments in 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A: Creating a 3D Slicer-based setup including SlicerROS2 and SlicerSOFA, able to provide with interaction between a robot model and a soft organ




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Setting up a base 3D Slicer, SlicerROS2 and SlicerSOFA.
2. Loading a Phantom Omni robot model (https://slicer-ros2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/robot-visualization.html#phantom-omni).
3. Creating a SOFA simulation for interaction between the robot and a soft organ.
4. Bridging the robot manipulation with the simulation using SlicerSOFA.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
