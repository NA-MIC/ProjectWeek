# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We intend to integrate the Julich Brain Atlas into our EpiSTIM 3D Slicer Extension.

EpiSTIM is a software project developed to assist neurosurgeons, neurologists and researchers in image processing tasks related to SEEG surgical procedures, from surgical stereotaxic planning to postoperative studies.


The Julich-Brain Atlas (Amunts et al. Science 2020) contains cytoarchitectonic maps of more than 200 areas of the human brain including cortical areas and subcortical nuclei. This atlas is widely used in the epileptology community both in SEEG planning and postoperatively to localize intracranial activity recorded during clinical cognitive tasks or other types of tasks.

The Julich-Brain is the foundation of the [Multilevel Human Brain Atlas](https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer/#/a:juelich:iav:atlas:v1.0.0:1/t:minds:core:referencespace:v1.0.0:dafcffc5-4826-4bf1-8ff6-46b8a31ff8e2/p:minds:core:parcellationatlas:v1.0.0:94c1125b-b87e-45e4-901c-00daee7f2579-290/@:0.0.0.-W000.._eCwg.2-FUe3._-s_W.2_evlu..7LIx..0.0.0..1LSm), which integrates neuroanatomical features with complementary maps of the molecular architecture, function and connectivity across multiple scales and is openly available to the research community via the Human Brain Project‚Äôs research infrastructure EBRAINS.




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Describe **what you plan to achieve** in 1-2 sentences.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Download the two versions of Julich Brain Atlas (on fsaverage and MNI templates) and visualize in 3D Slicer atlas.
2. Add Julich atlas terminology to the slicer
3. Add Julich data and terminology in EpiSTIM resources.
4. Map the Julich on Subject natif  space for the planning module of the SEEG procedure
5. Add the Julich maps on the MNI visualisation of the postoperative reconstruction of the SEEG procedure


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
