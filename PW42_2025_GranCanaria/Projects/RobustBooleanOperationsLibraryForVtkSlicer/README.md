# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Support robust boolean operations for 2D triangle meshes inside VTK or Slicer through an external library. This would allow an alternative to current boolean operations engine, `vtkbool` (from Sandbox's extension CombineModels module), which is better than the default one of vtk but still unstable for complex meshes such as the ones used in the biomedical domain 



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Expose a robust boolean operations library (e.g. Geogram) in Slicer's logic and GUI
2. Compile a robust boolean operations library (e.g. Geogram) as a vtk external module



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Add a CLI module for Slicer that encapsulates a robust boolean operation command line as part of Sandbox extension.
2. Create a draft PR to the upstream repo with the code changes that incorporate the feature and documentation on how to use it from GUI and a code snippet on how to use it from the python interpreter
3. If there is enough time, evaluate creating a boolean operations DynamicModeler tool



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Tested `geogram` successfully with mesh that made `vtkbool` fail
2. Current progress on effort integrating geogram boolean operations here.
3. Table that compares most "popular" boolean operations libraries from the [awesome geometry processing](https://github.com/zishun/awesome-geometry-processing#general-libraries) projects list:
