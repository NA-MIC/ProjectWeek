# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


trame is a Python-based framework that simplifies the creation of interactive visual applications for web, desktop, and Jupyter environments. It leverages powerful visualization libraries like VTK and ParaView, enabling developers to build applications without extensive web development knowledge.

This project aims to continue the ongoing effort of bringing 3D Slicer to the web using the trame framework. It will enable the creation of powerful modern web applications by reusing core components of 3D Slicer. Additionally, it will establish a connection between existing 3D Slicer modules and Slicer trame-based modules.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Help researchers and developers getting started with Slicer trame based applications
2. Allow running Slicer trame servers from an existing 3D Slicer install tree
3. Allow creating scripted modules compatible both with 3D Slicer and Slicer trame



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Hold a breakout session for Slicer trame during the PW42 NAMIC Week
2. Create a 3D Slicer extension to run Slicer trame server from 3D Slicer
3. Create a new template of scripted modules compatible both with 3D Slicer and Slicer trame



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
