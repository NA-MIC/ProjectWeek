# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


[OvSeg](https://github.com/ThomasBudd/ovseg/) is a deep learning-based library for the segmentation of high-grade serous ovarian cancer on CT images. Right now, to obtain the segmentations the user has to write some lines of Python code, making the tool not directly usable by non-technical people. It would be great to expose this algorithm in Slicer to be used in a codeless manner.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Expose OvSeg in 3D Slicer in order to provide a scalar volume as input and obtain the segmentations as a segmentation node




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Create a Slicer extension
2. Let the extension to install OvSeg via pip
3. Let the extension pull the CT volume, run the inference and push back the segmentations




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
