# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

OHIF viewer is a much used and much developed open source project exposing a fully functional DICOM viewer in React.js.
However some features, such as support for 4D images and fusion may be further improved.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Create or update the StackScroll tool for fusion windows.
Horizontal scrolling should update the opacity of the fusion.

Review window-levelling tools for PET, to allow window-level with
fixed minimum.

Create overlay tools for working with 4D images.
- Selection of split-tag
- Selection of time point to display

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

Create local test environment with OHIF viewer, Cornerstone3D tools and data (DONE).

Overlay controls for 4D images were already created in the XNAT-viewer project.
Investigate whether these can be easily implemented in the main project.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
