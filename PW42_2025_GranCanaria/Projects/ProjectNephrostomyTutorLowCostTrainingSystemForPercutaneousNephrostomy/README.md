# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Working to integrate recent developments on AI-based volume reconstruction from US into the existing Nephrostomy tutor system to improve guidance for trainees.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Integrate AI-based volume reconstruction from US segmentations
2. Test updated system on a low-cost phantom





## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. AI Model Integration

- Review & Select AI Model: Identify and evaluate recent AI-based models for US segmentation that meet the needs of the Nephrostomy tutor system.
- Model Integration: Develop an interface to integrate the selected AI model with the existing tutor system, ensuring seamless data flow from ultrasound segmentations to the volume reconstruction process.

2. System Update and Refinement

- System Architecture Modification: Modify the Nephrostomy tutor system architecture to incorporate real-time volume reconstruction from the AI model.
- User Interface Adjustments: Update the user interface to display reconstructed volumes alongside the current guidance information for trainees.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Low-cost phantom created.
2. Initial ultrasound segmentations in progress.
