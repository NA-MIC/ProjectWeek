# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


When initially released, TotalSegmentator was perceived to produce superior results, in comparison to the state-of-the-art at the time, anyway.

Over time, some of the deficiencies in the segmentations produced by TotalSegmentator have been identified. Further, new multi-organ segmentation models have been introduced.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Review segmentation results for a sample of images from IDC NLST collection, documenting the problems, across the publicly available multi-organ segmentation models. 





## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


For any model to be evaluated, we need to have segmentation results available for the specific set of CT images from NLST. 

At this moment, we have those for
* TotalSegmentator v1
* MOOSE

We are hopeful to also get segmentations for those selected specific cases for the following (given the list of participants in PW):
* OMAS (@aTamaz will you help?)
* AutoSeg3D (@diazandr3s can you help?)

We plan to use the SegmentationVerification extension developed by @cpinter in the PW41 earlier for the review (see [https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW41_2024_MIT/Projects/SegmentationVerificationModuleForFinalizingMultiLabelAiSegmentations/](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW41_2024_MIT/Projects/SegmentationVerificationModuleForFinalizingMultiLabelAiSegmentations/)).

We plan to summarize the results of the review in a publicly available document.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
