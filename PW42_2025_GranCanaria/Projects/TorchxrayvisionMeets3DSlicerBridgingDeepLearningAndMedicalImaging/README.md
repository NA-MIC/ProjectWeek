# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


This project focuses on developing a 3D Slicer module for the automatic processing of chest X-rays, integrating powerful deep learning capabilities provided by TorchXRayVision. The module streamlines radiological analysis by offering the following features:

- Segmentation: Automatically identify and outline anatomical regions in chest X-rays, such as lungs or other structures.
- Anomaly Detection: Detect abnormalities and highlight regions of interest for further investigation.
- Pathology Classification: Classify pathologies such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or other common conditions.

By combining the advanced machine learning models from TorchXRayVision with the versatile 3D Slicer platform, this module aims to provide a robust tool for clinicians and researchers to enhance diagnostic workflows, reduce manual workload, and improve consistency in radiological interpretation.
