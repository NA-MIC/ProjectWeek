# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


The project is to send results produced in OHIF to an IHE Report Creator using the Integrated Reporting Applications (IRA) profile.  




## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Help researchers/applications that produce annotation/findings/measurements/ect get their into the hospital information system in a standard compliant and secure manner.
2. Improve the encoding (SMOMED,RADLEX) of radiology reports.
3. Promote interoperability.  Once FHIRcast is added to the core OHIF services, applications will be able to send their results with minimal effort.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


The teams interested in participating would be provided with a FHIRcast hub account and OHIF code to help them send a FHIR Observation or ImagingStudySelection to the reporting system. The results would appear in the reporting application in a DiagnosticReport object and could be sent to an EHR.




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->



Post projectathon week, teams could obtain IHE conformance statement for Integrated Reporting Applications (profile IRA) and/or Interactive Media Report profile (IMR) by taking part in a connectathon.
