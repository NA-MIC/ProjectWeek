# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide of which ischaemic stroke is the more common. Mechanical thrombectomy involves inserting a catheter into the cerebral vasculature to remove blood clot. Catheter devices with different parameters are available to perform the procedure of which the correct one must be selected beforehand to avoid blockage. Clinical experience suggests that large lumen aspiration catheters were most commonly stuck at the anterior curvature of the carotid syphon.

In literature Waihrich et al. proposed to use 2D X-Ray to measure angles of vessel segments for classification. In our prevcious work we extended this approach to 3D measuring the minimal angle along the centerline of the carotid syphon. Based on 49 studies classified manually into 5 surgical classes by a medical expert, it turned out that this angle alone is not a good indicator of surgery class.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Objective A. Determine the vessel cross section area/diamater at given vessel centerline points.
2. Objective B. Figure out what other numerical parameters could be extracted for classification.
3. Obecjtive C. What methods could be used for classification taking into account the low number of studies.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. We'd like to extend our Slicer extension module to produce the numbers for classification.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
