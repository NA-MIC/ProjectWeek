# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

We are developing tools for segmentation of biological specimens (e.g. 3D microCT of fish or snakes).  The idea is that a Lab Director will define a project, such as what scan to segment, what anatomical structures to segment, the terminologies to use, etc.  Students or lab members would be assigned to segment subsets of the data.  We want to leverage existing data management tools, such as github for organizing issues and contributions, and jetstream2 for hosting data and computation.

There is a presentation about the ideas here: https://morphocloud.github.io/MorphoDepotDocs/

And there is an existing extension here: https://github.com/MorphoCloud/SlicerMorphoDepot

We are interested in facilitating collaborative segmentation, including dividing a whole project into tasks, managing allocation to tasks to segmenters, managing/merging contributions, etc. 

If you are interested in similar topics, please join our project!


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Networking: we would like to know how this fits with anyone else's projects and possibly collaborate
2. Ideally test the current extension on real world use cases
3. Talk with developers who are improving the terminologies and color modules about how to better structure our segmentations
4. Bonus: if time brainstorm tools for comparing segmentations / reviewing and merging segmentations
5. Bonus: work on MorphoDepotAccession module to make it easier to create segmentation task repositories
