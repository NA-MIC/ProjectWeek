# Project Description

The project aims to empower the biomedical research community in Latin America by localizing 3D Slicer to Spanish and Portuguese and improving tutorial localization infrastructure.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Solve the existing GitHub issues related to core functionalities of the extension Tutorial Maker. For example, not handling clicks or widget resizing during annotations blocks the user from finishing the tutorial.
2. Solve the existing GitHub issues raised during the African team tests. For example, buttons in the annotator that don't work properly, pdf exporter breaking the original format.
3. Fix problems in existing tutorials. For example, some missing slides in the PDF.
4. Improve the code's legibility and the extension's performance.
5. Collect more feedback from the users on the event.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. All the tasks (issues) are designated to pairs in the team, during the project week we will keep in continuous touch to solve each of these problems and any problem raised during feedback in the project week.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
