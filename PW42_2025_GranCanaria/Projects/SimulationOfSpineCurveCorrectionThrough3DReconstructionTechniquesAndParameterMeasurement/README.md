# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Digital Anatomics is a company focused on the devolpment of solutions in the field of personalized medical surgeries, specially in the area of the spine. In this project we would like to explore the reconstruction of personalized spine models from 2D imaging. We are currently developing a neural netkwork for this reconstruction task.
Using 3D Slicer as a tool for modeling and parameter measurement, we aim to apply the obtained information to perform precise patient curve measurements, simulate curve correction procedures, design detailed surgical plans, and assess post-operative outcomes. This approach will provide valuable insights to improve decision-making and enhance the precision of spinal surgeries.






## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Obtain DRR projections from CT scans for the obtention of paired training data 
2. Obtain precision measurmets for the 3D reconstructions (specially focused on the pedicle region)
3. Automatize landmark indentification on the 2D image  for the Cobbs angle measurment and study the correlation with the reconstructed vertebrae curvature






## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


**TBD** 




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


TBD 
2. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
