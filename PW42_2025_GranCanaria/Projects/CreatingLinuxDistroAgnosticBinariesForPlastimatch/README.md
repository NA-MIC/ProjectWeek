# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


Plastimatch is an open-source software for medical image processing and registration.
It is written in C++ and can be built from source in Linux and Windows.
Binary packages are available for Windows, Debian (plus its derivatives), and Arch Linux users.
No Linux distro-agnostic binaries are currently available.
During this week we will explore the possibility of creating a binary version of plastimatch easily portable/deployed in different Linux distros.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Create a Plastimatch distro-agnostic binary package



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Prepare a fresh linux virtual machine
2. Compile plastimatch from source
3. Figure out how to bundle/embed the required libraries  



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
