# Project Description

The goal of this project is to create and evaluate variants of a CNN for multi-label segmentation of prostate zones in MR images. The prostate zones are essential for lesion classification and therapy planning.
After successful segmentation, a sector map could be extracted that is used for PI-RADS reporting. This has the potential to automate and better standardize prostate lesion location reporting.

## Objective

1. Overlap-free segmentations of prostate zones.
1. Gap-free segmentations of prostate zones.
1. Improvement of current segmentation result, especially for the anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFS)

## Approach and Plan

1. Apply variants of volumentric CNN architectures.
1. Discuss ways to obtain overlap- and gap-free segmentations.
1. Discuss methods to create sector map. Which landmarks should be used?

## Progress and Next Steps
1. first results on more training data and with different models look promising
1. Obtained meaningful results for the AFS .
1. disucussions with people how to further improve the outcome.
