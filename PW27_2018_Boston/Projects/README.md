# How to create a new project


- Join the weekly [preparation call](../PreparatoryMeetings/README.md) to discuss your idea
- Post questions about the project idea and team on the [Project Week forum][forum], our communication mechanism as of PW27.
- When you are ready, add a new entry in the list of **Projects** by creating a new `README.md` file in subfolder in `Projects` folder, and copying contents of [project description template][project-description-template] file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to [Projects](.) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's __title, key investigators, project description sections__
1. Add a link to your project to the [main project list](../README.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
