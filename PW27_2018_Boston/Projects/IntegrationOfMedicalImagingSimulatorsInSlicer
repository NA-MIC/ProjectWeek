# Project Description

The main objective of this project is the development of a ultrasound (US) simulation prototype based on CT images.
Since the project is aimed to developing countries this prototype can mind the gap of gathering real dataset due to legal
issues.

## Objective

1. Establish a plan for the design of a prototype.
1. Integrate the prototype developed as a module on Slicer.
1. Develop the models for acoustic features deduced from the inspection of CT images.

## Approach and Plan

1. Define the set of CT images according to the criteria previously determinated.
1. Model the acoustic features.
1. Explore the way to extract volume information from 3DSlicer data structure.
1. Implement the simulator as a Slicer module.
