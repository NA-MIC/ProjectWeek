# Project Description
The main purpose of this project is to create a module that integrates an already created algorithm for guided ultrasound calibration into slicer.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Complete the basic GU.
1. Objective B. Integrate the algorithm
1. Objective C. Stream and freeze with real time ultrasond

## Approach and Plan

## Progress and Next Steps
1. Added a model node to show a sphere within the image on slicer
2. Added a cross hair fiducial to collect the image coordinate from the center of the straw
3. Created a loable extension to connect the python module to the C++ code
4. Built slicer on my computer
5. Built openCV 3.3
6. Made the view Red view only
7. Added inputs for ultrasound system IP address and port
8. Added ultrasound streaming and freeze buttons
9. Added ultrasound streaming and freezing capabilities to these buttons
10. Next steps: to intgrate the guided portion of the algorithm
