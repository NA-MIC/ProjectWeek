# Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a workflow to create pre-operative 3D prostate
cancer models from multi-parametric MRI data.  

## Objective

1. Segment the prostate, dominant lesion, neurovascular bundles, bladder neck,
urethra,and rectal wall.

2. Prepare segmented imaging data for 3D printing.
 
## Approach and Plan

1. Learn how to use relevant 3D Slicer modules for prostate segmentation (modules/extensions to consider: Segment Editor, DeepInfer, TOMAAT, SlicerProstate).

2. Review methods to segment other pertinent prostate anatomy in Slicer.

3. Create optimal outputs for 3D printing.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Learned and tested 3D Slicer segmentation tools.  Compared surface cut tool to manual segmentation and grow from seeds.

2. Continue to work on workflow for segmentation and printing- discuss with Danielle Pace.

3. Compare 3D Slicer models to models created with other software platforms.

4. Work with Anneke Meyer on deep learning for prostate segmentation for 3D Printed models.
