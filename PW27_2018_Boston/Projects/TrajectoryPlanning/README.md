# Migration of PILOT software for needle trajectory planning from MITK to 3DSlicer

## Key Investigators

- Caroline Essert (ICUBE / Universit√© de Strasbourg)
- Jean-Christophe Fillon-Robin (Kitware Inc.)
- Nicole Aucoin (Harmonus Inc.)


# Project Description

## Objective

1. Make the MITK plugin PILOT for needle/electrode trajectory planning compatible with 3D Slicer


## Approach and Plan

1. Create a Slicer module and plug PILOT in it


## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->

Progress:

1. Built Slicer on Mac OSX
2. Created a new extension with a loadable module in C++
3. Modified the UI to match the MITK PILOT plugin UI
4. Familiarized with the concepts of mrml scene, nodes, and connections in Slicer, thei link with vtk data structures, and made the link with MITK similar concepts
5. Started playing with the "manual" modification of nodes and vtkpolydatas
6. Started the process of building the core files of PILOT plugin along with Slicer (ongoing...)

Next steps:

1. Finish the build
2. Link UI widgets to functions in the PILOT code
3. Test !
