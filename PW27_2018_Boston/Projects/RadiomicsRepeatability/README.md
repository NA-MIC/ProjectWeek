# Project Description

## Objective

1. Understand appropriate measures and strategies to assess repeatability of radiomics features on test-retest data
    1. Critically review current approaches to this in literature
2. Design a study for assessing pyradiomics repeatibility on Prostate MRI test-retest data.

## Approach and Plan

1. Review/discuss approches from current literature 
2. Investigate the results on the Prostate MRI test-retest data
3. Draft a paper on pyradiomics repeatability evaluated on the Prostate MRI test-retest data
