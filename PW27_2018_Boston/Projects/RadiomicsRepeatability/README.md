# Project Description

## Objective

1. Understand appropriate measures and strategies to assess repeatability of radiomics features on test-retest data
     * Critically review current approaches to this in literature
1. Design a study for assessing pyradiomics repeatibility on Prostate MRI test-retest data.

## Approach and Plan

1. Review/discuss approaches from current literature
1. Investigate the results on the Prostate MRI test-retest data
1. Draft a paper on pyradiomics repeatability evaluated on the Prostate MRI test-retest data

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Short discussions about approach to evaluation and measures
1. Next step: Write the paper
