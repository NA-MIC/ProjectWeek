# Project Description

## Objective

1. Understand appropriate measures and strategies to assess repeatability of radiomics features on test-retest data
     * Critically review current approaches to this in literature
1. Design a study for assessing pyradiomics repeatibility on Prostate MRI test-retest data.

## Approach and Plan

1. Review/discuss approches from current literature 
1. Investigate the results on the Prostate MRI test-retest data
1. Draft a paper on pyradiomics repeatability evaluated on the Prostate MRI test-retest data
