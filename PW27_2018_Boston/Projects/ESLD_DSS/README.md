# Decision Support for End-Stage Liver Disease Transplants

## Key Investigators

- Mike Halle (BWH)
- Jennifer Nitsch (University of Bremen, Fraunhofer MEVIS)
- Hans Meine (University of Bremen, Fraunhofer MEVIS)

# Project Description

The waiting list for liver transplants is ordered according to a score
based on multiple criteria.  However, qualitative parts describing the
quality of live have been excluded from the score because they were
too easy to abuse.  These scores are important, though, so we would
like to introduce a quantitative, image-based scoring in order to

* bump up people with strong bodies who're close to / in a coma and to
* prevent transplants for people who are already too sick.
* Look at established clinical scores, are there subscores? Or more specific scores identified in the data (medical imaging/medical record)

Mike has roughly 500 MRI with clinical information that can be used
for this project.

## Objective

1. Understand standard/established clinical scores and effects/representation in medical imaging.
1. Familiarize with the data from this study.
1. Review and discuss current literature/ feature extraction approaches. 
1. This is kind of a Project Kick-Off: Create a work plan how to approach this problem also beyond the scope of the project week.

## Approach and Plan

1. Discuss features and feature extraction.
1. Radiomics is mostly done on CT, not so much on MR. Applicability of pyradiomics features?
