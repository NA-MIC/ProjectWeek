# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project has two independent sub-projects that can be executed independently of each other:

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Get Kaapana running on GKE
2.  Improving interaction of Kaapana and IDC

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

The next steps would be to try Kaapana with GKE: Therefore,

1. create a specific LoadBalancer.
2. resolve occurring issues
3. create deployment scripts
4. create multi-node setup (one node with GPU, one node without)
5. Run GPU tasks on GPU node, rest on CPU node.

For Kaapana and IDC:
Come up with a plan and possibilities how to improve the connectivity.

## Progress and Next Steps
