# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Slicer evolves at an amazing pace, and this makes the tutorials obsoleted pretty quickly. The current task would be to bring some of these up to date manually, but later on maybe this could be done automatically but later on the process could maybe be automated.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Review some tutorials and bring the up to date.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Review what changed in recent Slicer versions, that involves the selected tutorials, and do the screenshots.  Also, begin refreshing the presentations

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
