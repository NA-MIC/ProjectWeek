# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The classification of third molar extraction is a key factor in oral surgery. Developing a deep learning model to classify the difficulty score of extraction would be useful for surgeons and dentists.
This project aims to create a Slicer module that allows clinicians to obtain an extraction-difficulty grade by providing just the patient CT.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

To expose an already developed deep learning classifier in Slicer.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Identification of optimal classification parameters
2.  Expose weights into Slicer
3.  Generate extension

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

Done during this week:
1.  Obtained pth file with the model for deep learning classification.
2.  Implemented module extention in Slicer.
3.  Tested if the same label obtained in testing was the same that appeared in output in Slicer.

Future steps:
1.  Integrating weight files for the specific classification (maybe giving to the clinicians the possibility to download locally the right weights for their specific tasks).
2.  Specify what label score means.
3.  Other modifications for a general usage of the extention.
