# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

[dcmqi](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi) (DICOM for Quantitative Imaging) is a free, open source C++ library for conversion between imaging research formats and the standard DICOM representation for image analysis results.

This library has been around for quite some time, and gained some adoption, but has not been actively developed for the past few years, but with the efforts of @michaelonken development restarted.

The goal of this project would be to discuss what, if anything, could be done to make it more usable and address any of the needs that users might have.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Review any outstanding and new topics and feature requests
2.  Review issue tracker
3.  Review documentation

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  discuss with @jcfr any topics related to the possible integration with [ITK-Wasm dicom package](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-wasm/tree/main/packages/dicom)
2.  revisit basic python wrapping, similar to [pyplastimatch](https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyplastimatch) done by @denbonte
3.  clean up issue tracker
4.  discuss support of enhanced multiframe as SEG reference images and confirm understanding of the level of support of enhanced multiframe in Slicer/ITK (@michaelonken tried and failed to load any such images in Slicer)
5.  revisit documentation
6.  discuss interoperability testing with highdicom and dcmjs and maybe other tools.
7.  Help @JoostJM with possible integration into CaseIterator
8.  Discuss the use case for running conversion in absence of source image DICOM files, per request from @rfloca and as discussed in <https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/issues/390>.
9.  Discuss the process and schedule of upgrading dcmqi in MITK (@rfloca I did submit a PR, but not sure if those are reviewed? <https://github.com/MITK/MITK/pull/279>)

## Progress and Next Steps
