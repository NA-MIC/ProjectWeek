# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

FHIR represents a globally recognized standard for the exchange and integration of varied medical data types, such as clinical and imaging information. Adopting FHIR in medical image analysis platforms like Kaapana enables more in-depth analysis by combining clinical information with imaging data. Moreover, it facilitates the representation of analysis results in a standardized format. Initial steps towards adopting FHIR within Kaapana have been taken during the [38th Project week](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/KaapanaClinicalData/). However, aspects like the general mapping of tabular data into FHIR resources remains challenging which should be addressed in this project as well as the joint visualization of results from computational image analysis together with clinical data from the patients.
