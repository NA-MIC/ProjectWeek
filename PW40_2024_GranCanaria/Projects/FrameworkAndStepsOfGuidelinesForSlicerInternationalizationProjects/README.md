# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

We aim to discuss the basics of Slicer translations, independent of the language barriers and translational tools used.
We are open for discussions, ideas and recommendations!

Discuss and collect ideas about the topic with the members of the Slicer community.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Create and possibly conduct a short survey on what directions we could take, what would be important to grasp.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Created a form, and had it filled out by a good couple of people!
