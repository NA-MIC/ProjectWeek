# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project aims to implement a new interaction handle widget that can be used to modify linear transform nodes. This implementation will be based on the existing interaction handle pipeline in the Markups module, but with improvements to functionality and appearance. Both the transforms and markups interaction widgets will be derived from the same base class.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Demonstrate the current version of the new interaction widget.
2.  Gather feedback.
3.  Integrate changes into the Slicer core.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Provide an installer for precompiled version of Slicer that includes the new interaction widget.
2.  Submit a PR with the changes.
3.  Update based on feedback from the Project Week.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
