# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Design of Intra-operative surgical navigation framework combined with live calibrated anatomical models and Augmented Reality.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Xray-free Surgical Navigation tool
2.  Real time calibrated model integration
3.  Augmented Reality visualization for intra-operative surgery

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Build dynamic model from pre-operative imaging techniques
2.  Build Models-Patients calibration tools
3.  AR integration (unity3d based)

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Investigation of possible Surgical AR applications
2.  Idea sharing
3.  Networking
4.  Knowledge transfer
5.  Marker less tracking investigation
