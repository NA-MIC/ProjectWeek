# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

In this project, we want to investigate and compare several approaches to convert DICOM Structured reports into DICOM segmentation objects. We use the integrated SLIM Viewer in Kaapana to create Structured Reports on DICOM WSI files and also want to compare the QuPath viewer as additional DICOM WSI viewer in Kaapana.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A: Examine existing libraries to render the coordinates from the SR file as segmentation.
2.  Objective B: Examine conversion methods to create DICOM annotation objects from the SR files
3.  Objective C: Evaluate file formats of QuPath DICOM WSI annotations.
4.  Objective D: Explore integration capabilities of QuPath as Viewer in Kaapana

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Familiarize with the highdicom librariy
2.  Compare result with custom visulaizations
3.  Evaluate conversion tools for SR files
4.  Test PACS connectivity of QuPath

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Familiarized with the highdicom library for accessing the SR coordinates
2. Switching to a more generic way for rendering the coordinates
```ruby
for i in range(AnnotatetObjects3):
    Type=FileFull.ContentSequence[13].ContentSequence[i].ContentSequence[2].ConceptCodeSequence[0].CodeMeaning
    Coords3=FileFull.ContentSequence[13].ContentSequence[i].ContentSequence[3].GraphicData
    x_coords3 = [int((Coords3[i]-Origin_X)/spacing_x) for i in range(0, len(Coords3), 3)]
    y_coords3 = [int((Coords3[i]-Origin_Y)/spacing_y) for i in range(1, len(Coords3), 3)]
    if Type=='Tissue':
        tissue_list.append([x_coords3,y_coords3])
        color=(255,0,0)
    else:
        tumor_list.append([x_coords3,y_coords3])
        color=(0,0,255)
    contours = np.array([[[abs(x), abs(y)] for x, y in zip(x_coords3, y_coords3)]], dtype=np.int32)
```
.
```ruby
sr = hd.sr.srread("/Users/maximilianfischer/ProjectsMountDir/CMU-1/Consistent/SR/DICOM/1E447C90/E88940CE/4E17833F.dcm")
groups = sr.content.get_planar_roi_measurement_groups()
groups[0].roi
groups[0].roi.value
coords=[]
for x in range(groups[0].roi.value.shape[0]):
    coords.append([groups[0].roi.value[x][0],groups[0].roi.value[x][1]])
```
**Much shorter code!**
5. Rendering still done with opencv, but planning to switch to rasterio.
6. Bioformats as new DICOM conversion library to be supported in Kaapana (currently mostly based on PixelMed.)
