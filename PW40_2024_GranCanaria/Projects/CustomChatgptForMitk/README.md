# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Development of a custom ChatGPT tailored specifically for the users & developers of the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK). The objective is to create a conversational AI interface that assists MITK users or in navigating the software, troubleshooting issues esp. for developers, and obtaining relevant information. Leveraging the advances in the field of AI, the custom GPT (e.g. MITK GPT) can provide personalized assistance adapting to individual preferences and workflows.

One of the easiest ways to materialize this proposal to use the OpenAI's custom GPT feature and expand on it.

Even though the proposal is currently pitched for MITK, it could benefit other tools eg. Slicer3D, as well.
