# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

VolumeAXI is an ambitious project aimed at developing an AI system capable of automatically explaining and interpreting different application from CBCT scans.

The first clinical application of VolumeAXI is related to dentistry, on teeth impaction and the potential adjacent damages they could cause.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

For the first clinical application: classification of the position, the adjacent damages and the Kurol Overlap with explainability and interpretability of the results.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Pre-process of the CBCT to get the most of the data we need.

2.  Try different model training with PyTorch.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Actually trying different preprocessing of the CBCT on neural network.
