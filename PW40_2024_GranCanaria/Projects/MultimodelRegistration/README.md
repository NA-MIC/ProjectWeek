# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The "Multimodal Registration Project" aims to develop a system capable of aligning different medical imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. By focusing on the registration of Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)  with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we seek to create a unified imaging model that offers comprehensive insights into patient anatomy and pathology.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

*   The objective is to register MRI images with CBCT data accurately.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

*   Collected a robust dataset comprising MRI and CBCT files.
*   Compare the performance of three registration approaches : Generative Adversarial Network (GNA), agent-based action learning for non-rigid registration and Elastix's free-form deformation method.
*   Validate the model's accuracy through rigorous testing against established benchmarks.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

*   Data collection phase.
*   Reviewing available papers and code.
