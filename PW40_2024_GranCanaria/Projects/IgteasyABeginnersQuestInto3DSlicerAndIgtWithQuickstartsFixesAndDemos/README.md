# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Addressing the steep learning curve for beginners in 3D Slicer and Image-Guided Therapy (IGT) is crucial for fostering wider adoption and encouraging newcomers to explore the capabilities of these powerful tools. To mitigate the initial challenges, we propose a systemtic approach that includes the development of quickstart guides, a troubleshooting library, and the creation of demo projects.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Facilitating the initiation of projects for students and newcomers to Slicer IGT.
2.  Synthesizing information from various tutorials.
3.  Introducing learning projects.
4.  Proposing solutions for the most common installation and configuration issues.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Connect all tracking devices, including the installation and configuration of the appropriate drivers and software, and document each step thoroughly.
2.  Perform calibration steps for both the electromagnetic and optical tracking devices, and document the process.
3.  Attempt to replicate a working project on a different computer, documenting the steps taken.
4.  Review existing source documents and consolidate them into a single document, incorporating our documented experiences.
5.  Develop demo projects using the established infrastructure.
6.  Compile all issues encountered during these processes into a troubleshooting library.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
