# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project will aim to update the OHIF Viewer based on the new design of the Window Level interactions. Using per-viewport interactions makes a lot of sense (similar to commercial pacs viewers such as Siemens, and GE) since you can filter the options based on the available context (modality, 3D vs non-3D, fusion etc.)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Move the patient information to the top right instead of per viewport
2.  Improve upon current setup for the All-in-one-menu

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Follow zeplin designs

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->
