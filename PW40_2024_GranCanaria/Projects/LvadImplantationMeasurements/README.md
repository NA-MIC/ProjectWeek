# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation is a surgical procedure commonly employed in the field of cardiac surgery to support individuals with severe heart failure. This innovative technology involves the insertion of a mechanical pump, known as an LVAD, which assists the weakened left ventricle in pumping blood throughout the body. Knowing the LVAD position and angle after implantation is crucial for several reasons in the realm of cardiac surgery and patient care, such as: Optimal Device Function,
Minimizing Complications,
Improve the Quality of Life,
Long-Term Device Durability,
Postoperative Monitoring of Device Function,
Individualized Patient Care

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

We aim to create an extension that allows us to conduct measurements using standard methods.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

Collaboratively addressing the issue.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
