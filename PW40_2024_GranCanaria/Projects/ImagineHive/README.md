# Project Description

ImagineHive is a data management and analytics platform for hospital environments consisting of:

1. Web frontend to navigate, filter and edit patients data.
1. HIVE server backend for storing and sharing data and run data analytics and processing workloads. HIVE is a massively parallel distributed computing environment where the distributed storage library is linked with computational.
1. SlicerHIVE, a Slicer-based app that shows up in the web browser and offers 3D image visualization and analysis:
   * Browse and retrieve data from hospital PACS.
   * Viewer and markup tools for enhanced teamwork.
   * Automated segmentation tools.

ImagineHive is currently used at the Weill Cornell Medicine/Presbyterian NY hospital for clinical pre-operation review and planning.

## Objective

1. Present ImagineHive. Get feedback.
1. Learn about user needs.
1. Foster collaborations with potential users and similar development efforts.

## Approach and Plan

1. Have a meetings/demos with people interested.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Update of Slicer's DICOM browser to be more friendly for patient-oriented clinical workflows (visual appearance, better responsiveness - see [details](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW40_2024_GranCanaria/Projects/SlicerVisualDICOMBrowser/).
