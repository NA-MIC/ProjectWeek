# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Explore tools for clinician review and patient education using smartphone browser-based augmented reality.
There are two possible scenarios we could support:

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

A few of the features we'd like to explore:

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Review existing technologies for applicability for this use case
2.  Talk with Project Week attendees about similar needs and experiences
3.  If time, do some prototyping

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

*No response*

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
