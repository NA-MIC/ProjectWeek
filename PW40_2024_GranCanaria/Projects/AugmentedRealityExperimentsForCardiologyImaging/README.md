# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Explore tools for clinician review and patient education using smartphone browser-based augmented reality.
There are two possible scenarios we could support:

* Using existing SlicerHeart and SlicerVirtualReality extensions to support smartphone tracking
* Exporting Slicer scene data to a web page for rendering locally in smartphone browser

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Determine how much work would be required to make a system that could be tested in clinical scenarios
2. See what other people's experience has been in the feasibility and/or utility of such systems

A few of the features we'd like to explore:
* Using the a smartphone as a controller in SlicerVirtualReality
* Communicating events from smartphone to Slicer to control rendering
* Sending rendered images to phone vs. rendering in phone locally
* Exporting data to a stand-alone scene that could be viewed on a smartphone (e.g. by emailing a link or generating a QR code)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Review existing technologies for applicability for this use case
2.  Talk with Project Week attendees about similar needs and experiences
3.  If time, do some prototyping

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Resurrected WebServer tracker experiment
2. Updated https support with custom certificate that can be uploaded to android phone
3. Tried demo controlling volume rendering with phone
4. Showed demo to other prooject week attendees using another another android phone
5. Created a [pull request](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/7568) to add demo to Slicer
6. Discussed plans to make the demo into a more useful tool
   - Allow user to set relative position of themselves relative to the rendered scene
   - Use touch screen to control rendering modes and other elements in the Slicer scene
   - Transfer rendered images from Slicer to phone screen
   - Set up QR code so phone can easily access Slicer WebServer
   - Use websocket to minimize latency
   - Perform further testing, possibly as part of AR/VR developer courses
   - Define clinical scenarios and set up testing environment
