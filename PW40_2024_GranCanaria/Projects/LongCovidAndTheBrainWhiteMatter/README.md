# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

About 10% of COVID-19 survivors experience long-lasting symptoms known as long-COVID. The debilitating symptoms of PASC impact patientâ€™s health-related quality of life, earnings, caretaking activities for loved ones, and healthcare costs. There is no proven cure for PASC. Amongst the variable sequelae of long-COVID, the neuropsychiatric subtype of long-COVID (neuro-long-COVID) is characterized by fatigue, cognitive impairments, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our research project aims to understand how changes in the brain, specifically the white matter, contribute to the symptoms of the neuropsychiatric subtype of long-COVID.

We are particularly interested in the brain white matter fiber system that we term the dorsal vagal complex-corticolimbic fiber system (DVC-CLFS; Kikinis et al., in press). This fiber system interconnects cortical, paralimbic, limbic, and autonomic brain regions. It integrates them with bodily organs via the brainstem and the vagal nerve. The DVC-CLFS underlies brain-immune interactions and involves several centers in the brainstem. The principal fiber tract in the DVC-CFLS is the medial forebrain bundle (MFB).

While we have previously reconstructed the MFB, our new approach allows us to rebuild the streamlines reaching the brainstem. Using the Harvard Oxford Atlas (HOA, Rushmore et al., 2020), we will use whole brain tractography from 10 patients with long-COVID to select the Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB) at its entire extension.

As part of the project, we will demonstrate the method to reconstruct the MFB. We will offer tutorial of 3DSlicer of segmentation, reconstruction of brain white matter streamlines from whole brain tractography and video demonstration of the application of the Harvard Oxford Atlas.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A. Describe **what you plan to achieve** in 1-2 sentences. To test and apply a semi-automated approach to delineate a fiber tracts that reach the brain stem. Tractography in the brain stem is challenging as most fibers run parallel and very close to each other. Additionally, the  in nuclei of the brainstem from which tracts originate and are difficult to visualize.
2.  Teach the semi-automated approach using the Harvard Oxford Atlas.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.
    We will use diffusion and structural MRI, specifically whole brain tractography and T1 images, from 10 patients with long-COVID to select the Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB) at its entire extension to the brainstem.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->

In preparation: video on how to use Harvard Oxford Atlas for semi-automated delineation of fiber tracts whole brain tractography derived from diffusion MRI.
