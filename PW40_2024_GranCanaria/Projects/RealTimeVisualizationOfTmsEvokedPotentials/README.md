# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The 'Real-Time Visualization of TMS-evoked Potentials ' project is dedicated to realizing the streaming of EEG, with a specific focus on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) with signal processing to assess the quality of TEPs both offline and in real-time. This comprehensive approach aims to not only evaluate TMS-induced neural responses but to further understand and provide valuable insights into brain activity in real-time. Future projects will build upon the real-time TEP visualization tool by extending its goals to include real-time localization of sources associated with the evoked potentials.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Create a visualization tool for streaming real-time TEPs
2.  Include a module that also enables streaming of existing data
3.  Implement online signal processing methods to achieve clean visualization of TEPs

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Utilize methods such as Remote Data Access (RDA) and Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) to successfully stream online EEG data with TMS triggers for visualization
2.  Implement the visualization of streaming offline data in a real-time manner
3.  Create processing methods such as eliminating pulse effects and artifacts

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  The online streaming of EEG data coupled with TMS markers is working, however a specified type of visualization is required for implementation
