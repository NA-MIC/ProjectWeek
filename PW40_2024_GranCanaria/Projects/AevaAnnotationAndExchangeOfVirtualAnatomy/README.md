# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Representation of anatomy in a virtual form is at the heart of clinical decision making, biomedical research, and medical training. Virtual anatomy is not limited to description of geometry but also requires appropriate and efficient labeling of regions - to define spatial relationships and interactions between anatomical objects; effective strategies for pointwise operations - to define local properties, biological or otherwise; and support for diverse data formats and standards - to facilitate exchange between clinicians, scientists, engineers, and the general public. Development of aeva, a free and open source software package (library, user interfaces, extensions) capable of automated and interactive operations for virtual anatomy annotation and exchange, is in response to these currently unmet requirements.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Demo the current version of the aeva suite.
2.  Collect feedback and ideas

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Breakout session scheduled during the week.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
