# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

We plan to create a service that simplifies using AWS for cloud-based app streaming of Slicer (with or without extensions, or a Slicer custom app), effectively resulting in a single-click launch of the desired Slicer distribution in a new tab in the web browser.
In this project we are looking to gather requirements, expectations, limitations, or any kind of information we should take into account while planning and then developing the service.
