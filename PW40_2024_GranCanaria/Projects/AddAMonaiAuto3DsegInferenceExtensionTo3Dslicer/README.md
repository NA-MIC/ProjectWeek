# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project aims to implement MONAI Auto3DSeg in a 3DSlicer extension. This will enable fast inference with NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA and slower inference with CPU only.
Auto3DSeg is a relatively new technique in the MONAI project and our first experiments have been successful inference is not as complicated as using the MONAOLabel inference function.\
A future aim is to integrate Auto3DSeg training into the MONAILabel extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A. Implement Auto3DSeg into a new 3D Slicer extension.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

We have great starting code as well as 2 ready-to-use models from Andres Diaz-Pinto. We will build on that.
In addition, we will train a lung lobe and airway model which should be available at the PW.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Creating 2 Auto3DSeg models ready to use.
