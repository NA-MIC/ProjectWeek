# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

MONAI and PyTorch based medical image augmentation tool that can be integrated in Slicer.
The project aims to be a low-code version of the tool: <https://github.com/ciroraggio/AugmentedDataLoader>.

It's designed to operate on a dataset of medical images and apply a series of specific transformations to each image. This process augments the original dataset, providing a greater variety of samples for training deep learning models.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Creating an intuitive graphic interface for the module
2.  Parallelising the augmentation process to optimally utilise resources

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Create the extension
2.  Implement the augmentation process
3.  Try to parallelise the process so that it takes as little time as possible on large data sets

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
