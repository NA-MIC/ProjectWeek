# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

A key step in medical image processing, particularly in MRI images, is normalization of gray level intensities. This normalization is important to ensure that images have a consistent intensity scale, facilitating any future analysis. The purpose is to create a targeted extension for normalization of MR images in Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

*   The aim of the project will be to provide an extension to normalize the intensities of MRI images
*   It will be possible to choose different normalization methods.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Create an extension in which three normalization methods can be chosen: Zscore, WhiteStripe and Nyul.
2.  To be able to compare the different gray levels of images normalized by multiple methods.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
