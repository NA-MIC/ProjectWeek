# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->


We are working on a Slicer extension for automated segmentation of individual teeth in cone-beam CT dental scans using a deep-learning based approach.  We are focusing this week on getting it into the extension manager.



## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->


1. Submit the extension to the extension index.
2. Get extension approved in the next few weeks.




## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


1. Clean up remaining bugs with the code.
2.  Address issues on the extension submission checklist




## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
