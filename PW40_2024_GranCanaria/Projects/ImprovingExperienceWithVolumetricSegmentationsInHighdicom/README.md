# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

None

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Implementation in highdicom of checks to determine when a segmentation is a "volume" and populate optional metadata accordingly
2.  Implementation in highdicom of mechanism to retrieve a spatially-sorted volumetric segmentation, along with its affine matrix, in a consistent way regardless of the way that the segmentation file is laid out.
3.  Discuss and determine with DICOM experts and other interested parties whether changes to the DICOM standard may have a part to play in addressing some of the issues outlined above.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Implement a PR to highdicom library to address the points above
2.  Hold a meeting with relevant investigators (and anyone else interested) to decide on next steps (if any) regarding the standard

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
