# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Crowdsourced labels on medical imaging data can bridge the gap in labeled data required for training AI models for clinical applications.  Using crowdsourced labels on lung ultrasound videos that have been shown [(Duggan 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06773.pdf) to have comparable accuracy to medical experts, we will train a deep learning model using an approach [(Lucassen 2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143623) shown to work with expert-created labels and use the previous model performance to compare the new model's performance.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Using crowdsourced labels, train a deep learning model to classify lung ultrasound videos as having B-lines or having no B-lines.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Run model training and evaluation code from [(Lucassen 2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143623) on crowdsourced labels
2.  Compare model performance to same model [(Lucassen 2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143623) trained on expert-created labels.

## Progress and Next Steps
