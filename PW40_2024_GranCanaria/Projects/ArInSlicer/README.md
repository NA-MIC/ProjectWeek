# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

In previous Project Week events we have already presented our project [AR in Slicer](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/ARinSlicer/). On it, we managed to establish a communication bridge between Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer using OpenIGTLink communication protocol.

To achieve this, we created our own custom-made client-side socket in Unity using C# programming language. Nevertheless, our solution presented some computational limitations and only enable the exchange of one message of each kind (one transform and one image).

This project aims to optimize this issue. One option is to optimize how the system currently works with our C# scripts. Alternatively, we can explore the incorporation of the native OpenIGTLink scripts defined in Python or C++ language.

To give some context to the project, we focus this time on Birth Delivery Training. Birth delivery training equips healthcare professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to handle various scenarios during childbirth, ensuring the safety and well-being of both the mother and the newborn. This specialized training covers a spectrum of techniques, from normal deliveries to emergency interventions, preparing healthcare providers to manage complications effectively. Proper training enhances the capacity to recognize and address potential risks, fostering a timely response in critical situations.

In this project we aim at creating a new solution for birth delivery training based on an optimized version of the previous [AR in Slicer](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/ARinSlicer/) project. This new app will enable collaborative teacher-student interaction with the holograms for a better learning experience.

## Objective

This project has a double purpose:

1.  Optimize the message exchange by the platforms. One option for that is to explore the incorporation of OpenIGTLink protocol in Python language into the Unity project.
   1.1. Ultimately, we could to offer the possibility to work with the complete set of OpenIGTLink to enable the creation of more complete AR applications.
2.  Create a collaborative AR application that connects multiple HoloLens 2
   2.1. We focus on the field of birth delivery training. In this app, a teacher can show the birth delivery maneuvers to a student using this AR system.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Read existing literature on the utilization of Python in Unity
2.  Transfer Python scripts defining OpenIGTLink protocol to an empty Unity project
3.  Test their functioning in an application similar to the one presented in [AR in Slicer](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/ARinSlicer/) - Also available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/BSEL-UC3M/HoloLens2and3DSlicer-PedicleScrewPlacementPlanning.git).
4.  Create an application in Unity that can share multiple messages with 3D Slicer. The application should enable to decide if we want to be the master or the slave (to chose which user will manipulate the virtual information and which one will be limited to visualization). It should be possible to change this option dynamically.
5.  Import all necessary models to the scene in Unity
6.  Register virtual information with a mannequin in real life to provide haptic feedback
7.  Combine this information with a tracker (EMTS) to record the movement of tools in real life.
8.  Replicate the movement of actual tools in our virtual models using the same OpenIGTLink bridge

## Progress and Next Steps
Upon arriving here, we found some different ways to address this problem, so finally, we did not follow the original plan, but explored these other approaches:

![ProgressDiagram](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/assets/66890913/803249b1-eac1-4d40-8b3e-957cd021bb79)

These days we have tried multiple approaches for displaying 3D Slicer information in Microsoft Hololens 2 (HL2).
These are the results:
We have three options: Stream information to HoloLens 2 from a computer, build an application directly in HL2, or use 3D Slicer.
### 1. Computer
#### 1.1. UWPOpenIGTLink
JC provided us with a [Windows Runtime component](https://github.com/IGSIO/UWPOpenIGTLink) for OpenIGTLink. Upon building it (for x64 architecture, as we want to read it from a computer), it creates a Winmd that should provide direct access to the libraries. We tried both methods here: building the app for the computer and directly running it from the Unity editor. None of the options worked, as they are not Universal Windows Platforms.

#### 1.2. OpenIGTLink
We decided to build the original [OpenIGTLink protocol in C++](https://github.com/openigtlink/OpenIGTLink/blob/master/Documents/Protocol/index.md) for an x64 architecture and then create a wrapper in C# to read these libraries in Unity. This has the potential to work, although it requires quite a lot of hard work and could not be finished this week. We will keep on exploring this possibility during the next months.

#### 1.3. Python scripting
It is possible to implement [python scripts in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scripting.python@6.0/manual/index.html). Theoretically, since there is a [python version for the OpenIGTLink protocol](https://github.com/lassoan/pyigtl), it should be possible to feed Unity with the OpenIGTLink Python library to seamlessly exchange all types of messages. Nevertheless, due to time constraints, we could not test this approach during this week. Maybe on the next one...

### 2. Microsoft HoloLens 2
The next alternative was to actually build the application on ARM64 architecture for HoloLens 2 using the [UWPOpenIGTLink](https://github.com/IGSIO/UWPOpenIGTLink). In this case, the Winmd can be read because HL2 is a Universal Windows Platform, so no wrapper is needed. Therefore, this option should be suitable too, and we might also work on it during the next months.

### 3. 3D Slicer
Finally, now [OpenXR is finally available in 3D Slicer](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality), we also explored this path to stream information without depending from Unity.
This worked and seamlessly displays the 3D view in 3D Slicer directly into HoloLens. Still, some factors should be improved:
  - Registration between 3D Slicer and HoloLens 2 is not well managed, and models are usually rendered too far away from the user. Our current approach is to perform fiducial based registration to bring models closer.
  - Models can be grabbed and dragged in the scene to see them from different perspectives. However, only near interaction is available (no far interaction, voice commands...) --yet!
  - Models cannot be manipulated independently and they move as a block. To prevent this, so far, we simply "toggled selectable" those we didn't want to interact with.
  - So far, no UI is visible from HL2 so the user cannot press buttons or interact with 3D Slicer interface from the glasses.
  - None of this is officially available in any 3D Slicer release, but everything is working on our own built. 3D Slicer should be upgraded soon with these features once some issues are fixed, though.

Please, check the results of our implementation in the following video:
