# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project aims to clarify best practices and discuss possible fixes for linking segmentation and imaging data with different geometries using dcmqi. This question arose during curation of The Brain Resection Multimodal Imaging Database (ReMIND) for TCIA and subsequent challenges with viewing unlinked segmentations using the OHIF viewer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A: Discuss possible fixes for this dcmqi linking issue when using imaging data and segmentations with differing geometries.
2.  Objective B: Ensure the ReMIND data available in TCIA has the appropriate linking between segmentations and imaging, and can be viewed using OHIF.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Get input from all stakeholders on best practices and potential fixes for this linking problem.
2.  Establish a plan for next-steps.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
