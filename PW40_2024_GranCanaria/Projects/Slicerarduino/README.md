# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

[SlicerArduino](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/7/3/109) is a Slicer extension that allows to stream data from/to [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) (and Arduino-like) board.
The extension is already deployed but several improvements can be made.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Add Bluetooth support
2.  Manage connection drop
3.  Think about switching from pyserial to qt serial module

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Edit SlicerArduino code having Arduino board with Bluetooth module on the side
2.  Discuss with people about switching from pyserial to qt serial module

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

*No response*

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
