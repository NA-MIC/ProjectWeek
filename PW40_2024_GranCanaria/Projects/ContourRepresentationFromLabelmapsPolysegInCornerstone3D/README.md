# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

I've been working hard on implementing polySEG in cornerstone3D, and I'm happy to report that I've already implemented the following converters:

- Labelmap to surface
- Surface to labelmap
- Contour to surface
- Contour to labelmap

However, we still have two converters remaining that seem to be more complex: surface to contour and labelmap to contour. We're excited to tackle these challenges and continue moving forward. This project aims to work on this

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Finish the surface cutting in each slice in the viewport and provide proper API around it
2.  Try to implement two versions one for rendering and one for editing

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
