# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project aims at getting a detailed understanding of the capabilities of available (Python) libraries and tools that implement DICOMweb and how they facilitate working with pathology whole-slide images (WSI) via DICOMweb services. The summarized knowledge will be the basis for discussions and help to decide what further work makes sense (e.g. new library, contributing specific functionality to an existing library etc.).

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A: Have a document (document A) describing capabilities of available tools.
2.  Objective B: Have a document (document B) summarizing discussions and plans for further work.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Get some practical experience with the libraries: wsidicom, dicomslide (both underlyingly using dicomweb_client)
2.  Set-up document A
3.  Set-up times to discuss during project week
4.  Summarize discussion in document B

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository.
     If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
