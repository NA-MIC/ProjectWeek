# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Developing an enhancement for the AQ3DC (Automatic Quantification 3D Computation) Slicer module. The upgrade aims to incorporate a comprehensive statistics output feature to complement the existing clinician-focused output, enabling rapid computation and analysis of volumetric data.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

To enhance the AQ3DC Slicer module by integrating a statistics output feature for detailed data analysis, thereby improving its utility for research and clinical purposes.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

*   Review the existing AQ3DC module to identify the current output capabilities and limitations.
*   Design a statistics output framework that aligns with the needs of end-users, ensuring it is intuitive and user-friendly.
*   Implement the statistics output feature, incorporating feedback from beta testing with a select group of clinicians and researchers.
*   Conduct thorough testing to validate the accuracy and reliability of the statistical computations.
*   Prepare documentation and tutorials for the new feature to facilitate easy adoption by users.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

*   Completed the initial review of the AQ3DC module's output capabilities.
*   Drafted a preliminary design for the statistics output feature and gathered feedback from potential users.
