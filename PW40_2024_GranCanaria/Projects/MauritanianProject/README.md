# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The Mauritanian approach aims to make 3D Slicer accessible to a broader audience of users and researchers in the medical field. Various projects have been completed, initiated, or are currently under consideration, including:

- The anatomy atlases created by professors Idriss and Yahya in 2018 enabled medical students to visualize and quickly assimilate human body parts through the use of 3D Slicer.
- Other applications for generating 3D models of baby and expectant mother mannequins.
- Implementation and integration of three breast cancer segmentation methods by one of our researchers: An adaptive fuzzy C-means algorithm, An adaptive k-means algorithm, and an adaptive Otsu thresholding. Integration is underway.
- Processing and segmentation of medical images with 3D Slicer and Deep Learning in the context of an integrated approach for analyzing various medical data from Mauritania. This is the subject of an ongoing doctoral thesis.
- Other upcoming applications are planned.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished. -->

*We have developed an extension for 3D Slicer to perform medical image (volume) segmentation using the K-Means algorithm. Specifically, we have implemented an adaptive version of K-Means, which allows segmentation based on pixel intensity.

We encountered several challenges during volume processing and rendering, as well as in finding alternatives to libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy, and OpenCV to integrate them into the 3D Slicer API.

Ultimately, we successfully segmented the images using both the adaptive K-Means and the classic K-Means methods. However, these results still require improvement and testing on various types of medical images to ensure their reliability*
