# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The Mauritanian approach aims to make 3D Slicer accessible to a broader audience of users and researchers in the medical field. Various projects have been completed, initiated, or are currently under consideration, including:

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Facilitate access to 3D Slicer for medical students to enhance understanding and manipulation of the human body.
2.  Generate 3D models of baby and expectant mother mannequins.
3.  Contribute to enriching breast cancer segmentation methods by introducing and comparing user choices in 3D Slicer.
4.  Aim to make 3D Slicer usable by a wider audience of Mauritanian and Arabic-speaking users (practitioners, students, and researchers).
5.  Explore cutting-edge techniques in medical image processing and segmentation, especially those based on Deep Learning, implement them, and evaluate performance.
6.  Anticipate additional upcoming applications.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Anatomical Atlas:
2.  3D Model of Baby and Expectant Mother:
3.  Introduction of 3 Segmentation Methods:
    4 .Arabization of 3D Slicer:
4.  Segmentation of Medical Images from Mauritania:
5.  Other upcoming applications:

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Progress of the anatomical atlas: ...
2.  Progress in generating 3D models of the baby and expectant mother.
3.  Progress in integrating the 3 segmentation methods.
4.  Progress of the doctoral thesis: Segmentation of Medical Images from Mauritania.
5.  Progress in contributing to the Arabic translation:
6.  Other upcoming projects.
