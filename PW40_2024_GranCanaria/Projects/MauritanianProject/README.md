# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The Mauritanian approach aims to make 3D Slicer accessible to a broader audience of users and researchers in the medical field. Various projects have been completed, initiated, or are currently under consideration, including:

- The anatomy atlases created by professors Idriss and Yahya in 2018 enabled medical students to visualize and quickly assimilate human body parts through the use of 3D Slicer.
- Other applications for generating 3D models of baby and expectant mother mannequins.
- Implementation and integration of three breast cancer segmentation methods by one of our researchers: An adaptive fuzzy C-means algorithm, An adaptive k-means algorithm, and an adaptive Otsu thresholding. Integration is underway.
- Processing and segmentation of medical images with 3D Slicer and Deep Learning in the context of an integrated approach for analyzing various medical data from Mauritania. This is the subject of an ongoing doctoral thesis.
- Other upcoming applications are planned.


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

- Generate 3D models of baby and expectant mother mannequins.
- Contribute to enriching breast cancer segmentation methods by introducing and comparing user choices in 3D Slicer.
- Explore cutting-edge techniques in medical image processing and segmentation, especially those based on Deep Learning, implement them, and evaluate performance.
- Anticipate additional upcoming applications.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

- 3D Model of Baby and Expectant Mother
- Introduction of 3D Segmentation Methods:
