Simulated ultrasound-guided needle insertion for kidney procedures

## Key Investigators
- Lyla Mu (Robarts)
- Tamas Ungi (Queen's)

# Project Description
Create a low-cost simulator for ultraosund-guided needle insertions with simulated kidney

## Objective
1. Simulate ultrasound and needle with ARUCO tracking
1. Visualize in SlicerVR

## Approach and Plan

1. Start from US simulated project at last project week and set it for kidney
1. Test SlicerVR for visualization
