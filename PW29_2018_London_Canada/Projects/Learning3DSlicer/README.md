# Learning 3D Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Hareem Nisar

# Project Description

<Learn different functions of 3D Slicer>

## Objective

- Objective A. Understand how to include jupyter notebook and python libraries in 3D Slicer.
- Objective B. Segment a shape in a volume and define a similar ROI
- Objective C. Define a calibration method for a virtual cone shaped image using magnetic tracking
- Objective D. Making custom Slicer apps, gui, etc. (if time permits)

## Approach and Plan

1. Attend the segmentation and IGT sessions.
1. Try making a module for data acquisition through TEE
1. Implement my Jupyter notebook code directly into Slicer
