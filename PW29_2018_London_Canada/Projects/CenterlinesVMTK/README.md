# Project Description

We're developing a Slicer application that uses the Slicer VMTK extension to find the centerlines of segmented arteries, and uses these centerlines to reformat medical images. This allows a user to navigate through an artery to find regions of stenosis and occlusions.

## Objective

1. Compile SlicerExtension-VMTK with VTK9 and Qt5. Fix problems compiling VMTK with the most recent VTK.
2. Create a glyph or marker to follow the 2D slice position on a straightened artery view.
3. Using SlicerExtension-VMTK effectively. Extract centerlines using ComputeCenterlines module, rather than ExtractNetwork.

## Approach and Plan

1. With experts, examine changes that caused VMTK to stop compiling.
2. Understand options to add glyphs to slice views.
3. Understand use of ComputeCenterlines, and see if new tools would be useful.
