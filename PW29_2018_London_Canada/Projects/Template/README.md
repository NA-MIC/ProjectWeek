# Project Description

I'm still new to creating modules for Slicer and would like to learn how to combine and use existing extensions.

## Objective

1.  My goal for the week is to learn how to use and combine existing modules in my own Python project.

## Approach and Plan

1. Dedicating uninterrupted time to learn
2. Talking to people more knowledgable than myself
