## Description

## Objective

Integrate integrated GLSL based algorithmd into OHIF segmentation infrastructure.

Make use of the OHIF plugin infrstructure.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Identify best algorithms to work with, probably start with GrowCut
1. Look at how to pass image data between OHIF and plugin
1. Come up with reasonable user interfacer

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Working example of GLSL grow cut implemented before project week used as topic for discussion
1. Developed plans for further integration with OHIF plugin architecture
1. Explored sharing of GLSL code between OHIF and Slicer (via VTK GPU classes with Kyle)
