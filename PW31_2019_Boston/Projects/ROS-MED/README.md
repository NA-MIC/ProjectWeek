# ROS-MED: Platform for Medical Robotics Research Based on ROS and 3D Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Junichi Tokuda (Brigham and Women's Hospital)

# Project Description

We will extend the tutorial on ROS-MED, a platform for medical robotics research based on ROS and 3D Slicer.
Specifically, we will find out a way to import the robot model from CAD software. We will use a needle guide manipulator for MR-guided prostate biopsy (Smart Template) as an example project.

Details of ROS-MED can be found in [our recent workshop at International Symposium on Medical Robotics](https://rosmed.github.io/)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Streamline the development of software for image-guided robot-assisted interventions

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Convert the CAD files for Smart Template to the ROS model (URDF and XACRO).
1. Test controlling and visualizing the robot on 3D Slicer.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
