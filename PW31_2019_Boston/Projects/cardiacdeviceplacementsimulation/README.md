# Project Description

<Pre-operative device placement holds a potential to characterize the anatomical relationship of cardiac device (valve/catheter) to the surrounding structures before actual surgery. The deformation and displacement of the device across the cardia cycle can also be assesed pre-operatively. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Creating 3D models of cardiac devices (for example Transcatheter aortic valve/Melody valve/Mitral valve).
1. Objective B. Simulation of these models in 4-dimensional cine model of heart
1. Objective C. Calculating degree of displacement and deformation of the models across the cardiac cycle

## Approach and Plan
