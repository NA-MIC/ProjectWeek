# Project Description

Software for data-driven white matter parcellation
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Improve user documentation and results checking documentation based on user feedback.
1. Investigate alternatives for documentation.
1. Create batch script to run entire pipeline.
1. Update all versions of documentation; remove unused.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Batch script for running the fiber clustering pipeline.
1. Give details about each processing step and the expected outputs.
1. Have users from technical and clinical fields tested.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Batch script for running the fiber clustering pipeline is done.
1. Tested by mutltiple collaborators.
1. Documentation of step-by-step instructions is done. It currently in a Google Doc and needs to be released donline soon.
