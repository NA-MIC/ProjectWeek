# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The SPINE virtual laboratory allows the actors involved int the research enterprise to work around Scientific Questions. Data can be directly imported into SPINE but it can also be imported from other data management systems. So far SPINE has the capability to import data stored in LORIS (A longitudinal study data management tool). In this project week we would like to connect SPINE to XNAT.

## Objective
Connect SPINE with XNAT.

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Understand the API and data structured exposed by XNAT
1. Objective B. Define configuration parameters to be used when connecting/replicating data from XNAT to SPINE

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Understand the API and data structured exposed by XNAT in order to get access and extract data
1. Test the API exposed by XNAT in a real scenario
1. Implement a replication protocol to import data from XNAT

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

### Progress
1. Set up testing XNAT and SPINE instances
1. Created connection between SPINE and XNAT (authentication)
1. Created conceptual mapping (schema mapping) between XNAT and SPINE main concepts
1. Started implementation to transfer metadata from XNAT to SPINE

### Next Steps
1. Finish the transference of metadata
1. Test in a real scenario
