# Project Description

Advances in machine learning and deep learning have made it possible to embed the knowledge of experienced physician/radiologist into computational models and have shown state-of-the art performance in various image analysis tasks including computer-assisted detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of several forms of cancers including prostate cancer. However, models are not fully integrated with the current standard of care in clinic. We have developed prostatecancer.ai which enables deployment of AI models in a web-browser while simultaneously providing standard image viewing and reporting schemes.

## Objective

1. Integrate James A Petts’s segmentation tools and cornerstone’s overlay tool
2. Develop a feature that would allow end users to upload their own DICOM images

Using prostatecancer.ai’s AI Probe feature, end users can instantly know whether a patient has prostate cancer or not.
