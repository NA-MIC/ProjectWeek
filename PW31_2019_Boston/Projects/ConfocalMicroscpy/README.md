# Confocal Microscopy in Slicer

## Key Investigators

- [Steve Pieper][steve] ([Isomics][isomics])
- Brad Lowekamp (NIH NIAID)
- Andrey Fedorov (BWH)

## Description

## Objective

See how Slicer can be used for microscopy images.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Compare with other tool (ImageJ / FIJI)
2. Identify key operations
3. Identify sample data

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Experimented with 7Gig 15 slice 7 channel images in nrrd format
2. Looked at data in FIJI (often crashed, java exceptions...)
3. Loaded in Slicer
  * confirmed that we can view and interact
  * ran SimpleITK filters
  * volume rendered
