# Multi time point cardiac sequence segmentation

## Key Investigators

- Sarv Priya 1 (University of Iowa)
- Andras Lasso 2 (Queen's University)

# Project Description

<!-- Creating 4-dimensional blood pool and myocardial segmentation of multiple phases of cardiac CT to play them as cine file  -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Creating a work flow dedicated for multitime point cardiac segmentation.
1. Objective B. Both blood pool and myocardial segmentation
1. Objective C. Hollowing the volume rendered cardiac CT images (to see internal anatomy by making the blood pool hollow or transparent)
1. Objetive  D. Superimposition of segmented cardiac files over volume rendered CT images

## Approach and Plan
