# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

FEniCS is a popular open-source (LGPLv3) computing platform
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
FEniCS enables users to quickly translate scientific models
into efficient finite element code.
With the high-level Python and C++ interfaces to FEniCS,
it is easy to get started,
but FEniCS offers also powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers.
FEniCS runs on a multitude of platforms
ranging from laptops to high-performance clusters.
The goal of this project
is to integrate FEniCS into a Slicer extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Install FEniCS Python packages inside Slicer.
1. Run FEniCS demo inside Slicer.
1. Create Slicer FEniCS extension.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Installed FEniCS Python packages inside Slicer (see [Slicer FEniCS Installation](slicer-fenics-install.md)).
1. Created [Slicer FEniCS](https://github.com/benzwick/slicer-fenics) extension to run FEniCS demo inside Slicer.
