# How to create a new project

1. Discuss your project idea and who would be interested in joining the project at the project week preparation teleconferences or on [Project Week forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/project-week).
1. Create a new project page based on the project description template
   - Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy the full content of the page to the clipboard
   - Go to [Projects][projects-folder] folder on GitHub
   - Click on "Create new file" button
   - Type `YourProjectName/README.md` (_YourProjectName_ is a shortened name of your project, without spaces)
   - Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
   - Update at least your project's __title, key investigators, project description sections__
   - Click "Commit new file" button at the near the bottom of the page. Accept to fork the repository or create a pull request, if asked (it means that your github account has not given direct write access to the repository yet; you will get write access once your pull request has been reviewed).
1. Add a link to your project to the project list
   - Open [main project list][projects-list]
   - Scroll down to the project list section and add a line to one of the project groups: `[Full title of your project](Projects/YourProjectName/README.md) (your name, followed by name of other contributors)`

If you have any questions or need help with creating your project, post your request to [Project Week forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/project-week).
