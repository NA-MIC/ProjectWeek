# Project Description

<!-- Currently, only one user can interact with virtual reality scene at one time limiting the sharing of scene between multiple users. Also, while using Virtual reality headsets, the headset works as a slicer to see the inside anatomy for example in heart. However for this we need to bring the model close to the headset and the moment you try to rotate or change size of model- that cut-plane is lost. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A.Making use of controllers to slice the anatomy dynamically  so that once the cut plane is applied, it remains so while further interaction with the model (for example once you have make any cut-plane inside the model to see internal anatomy- it should not change while rotating or changing the size of model)
1. Objective B. Sharing the virtual scene with other person (If more than one person can share the same model, it will be helpful to interact in the virtual environment and can help in discussing especially with the patients)
1. Objective C. SHaring the virtual scene with any phone applications like merge cube etc.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
