# Registration of Intel RealSense depth camera image to CT + marker based tracking

# Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a module in Slicer for registering [Intel RealSense][realsense] depth data to a CT scan of a patient's 
head and maintain this registration using an optical marker. The module will use facial surface anatomy to perform initial 
registration between the RealSense and a CT scan. An optical marker will be rigidly fixed to the patient's head within the 
camera's field of view and used to preserve registration when the patient's face is no longer visible.

## Objective

Objective A: Perform patient registration using segmented facial surface anatomy and depth images streamed from the Intel RealSense

Objective B: Maintain patient registration after face is no longer visible using an optical marker tracked by the Intel RealSense RGB camera
