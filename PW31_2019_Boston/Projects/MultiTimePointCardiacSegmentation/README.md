# Multi time point cardiac sequence segmentation

## Key Investigators

- Sarv Priya (University of Iowa)
- Andras Lasso (Queen's University)

# Project Description

<!-- Creating 4-dimensional blood pool and myocardial segmentation of multiple phases of cardiac CT to play them as cine file  -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Creating a work flow dedicated for multitime point cardiac segmentation.
1. Objective B. Both blood pool and myocardial segmentation
1. Objective C. Hollowing the volume rendered cardiac CT images (to see internal anatomy by making the blood pool hollow or transparent)
1. Objetive  D. Superimposition of segmented cardiac files over volume rendered CT images

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.
1. ...
1. ...

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Using resequece registration, a transform sequence was created and then segmentation from fixed frame was applied to other segments to create multitime point segmentation.
2. Next step will be to automate some of the steps (smoothening, hollowing etc.)
3. Will upload the demo video soon!
