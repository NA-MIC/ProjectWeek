# High resolution, comprehensive atlases of the human brain morphology

## Organizers

- Sylvain Bouix (Brigham & Women's Hospital)
- Marek Kubicki (Brigham & Women's Hospital)
- Nikos Makris (Massachusetts General Hospital)

# Breakout Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the breakout and intended results. -->
The goal of the project is to develop and disseminate state-of-the-art, high-resolution full brain anatomical atlases, based on the manual parcellation of 200 MRI images provided by the Human Connectome Project.
This atlas will be made compatible with anatomical nomenclature, easily portable to the majority of neuroscience tools and software platforms, and editable, so other experts can contribute their anatomical knowledge to the tool.
