# Uncertainty estimation for feature based registration

## Key Investigators

- William Wells

# Project Description

The overall goal is to use Gaussian process regression to estimate both deformations,
as well as posterior distributions on deformations, from pairs of corresponding image
features.

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

This week we will implement a radial basis function spline using convolution and FFTs.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.
## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Completed it.
1. Held several discussions with participants on the topic, segmentation, 3D Slicer.
