# Project Description

New release of the Chest Imaging Platform (last one supporting Python 2!).

Chest Imaging Platform migration to Python 3.


## Objective

1. Release an updated version of the Chest Imaging Platform (probably the last one that will support Python 2)
1. Slicer nightly/last release compatibility of the new release
1. Migrate the whole platform to Python 3 and check for tests issues

## Approach and Plan

1. Code, build, test, cry
2. Repeat until all tests are passing or we are out of tears

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->
1. After some work during the week, integration seems very reasonable, and not many issues have come up so far.
1. The next release will be only Python2 compatible, but next one will support both versions
