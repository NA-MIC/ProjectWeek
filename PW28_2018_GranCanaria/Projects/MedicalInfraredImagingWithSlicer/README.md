## Project Description

This project is a next step in the one presented during [27thPW NA-MIC](https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW27_2018_Boston/Projects/MedicalInfraredImagingwithSlicer/), a research collaboration between the public research [institute IACTEC](http://www.iac.es/) and the [University of Las Palmas de Gran Canarias(ULPGC)](http://www.ulpgc.es/) in order to use InfraRed (IR) sensors and advanced image processing techniques in 3D Slicer for medical diagnosis.
It is intended mainly for foot ulcers detection in diabetic patients. The infrared cameras have been integrated and connected to 3D Slicer using the PLUS toolkit and a new medical thermal infrared extension is being developed.


## Objectives

1. Implementation of a new extension for medical thermal infrared images.
1. Development and testing of a new module for foot ulcer assessment based on thermal infrared images.
1. Performance and efficiency improvements.

## Approach and Plan

1. First steps in the development of the new extension.


## Progress and Next Steps

1. .
