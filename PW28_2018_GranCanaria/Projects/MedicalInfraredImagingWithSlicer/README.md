## Project Description

This project is a continuation of the one presented during the 27th PW NA-MIC, in which a research collaboration was established between the public research institute IACTec and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canarias (ULPGC). The project uses InfraRed (IR) sensors and advanced imaging processing techniques in 3D Slicer for medical diagnosis, including diabetic foot ulcer assessment. The infrared cameras have been integrated and connected to 3D Slicer using the PLUS toolkit and a new medical thermal infrared extension is being developed.


## Objectives

1.	Implementation of a new extension for medical thermal infrared images.
2.	Development and testing of a new module for foot ulcer assessment based on thermal infrared images.
3.	Performance and efficiency improvements.

## Approach and Plan

This project is a continuation of the one presented during the 27th PW NA-MIC, in which a research collaboration was established between the public research institute IACTec and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canarias (ULPGC).

## Progress and Next Steps

1.	Improve and test the acquisition, segmentation and registration modules for foot ulcer assessment in Slicer 3D.
2.	Discuss and test other segmentation and registration approaches. 
3.	Develop a new Slicer module for semi-automatic foot ulcer assessment using contralateral temperature comparison 
4.	Testing.
