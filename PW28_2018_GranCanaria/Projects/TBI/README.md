### Longitudinal analysis of white matter connectivity changes prompted by concussions 

## Key Investigators

- Andrei Irimia (University of Southern California)
- Lauren O'Donnell (BWH - HMS)

# Project Description

Concussions (also known as mild traumatic brain injuries, or mTBIs) have relatively high incidence in the elderly and increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders. The effects of concussions upon the human connectome and upon local white matter are poorly understood. This project will explore the potential of Slicer tools to assist the study of white matter (WM) degradation after concussions using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

## Objective

1. Objective A. Assess the range of existing Slicer functionality for longitudinal DTI analysis
1. Objective B. Formulate strategies for using Slicer tools to quantify white matter (WM) changes after concussions
1. Objective C. Explore avenues for collaboration on concussion imaging research between BWM and USC

## Approach and Plan

1. To be determined.
