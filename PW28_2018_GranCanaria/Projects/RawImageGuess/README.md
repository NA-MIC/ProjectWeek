# Project Description

Sometimes it occurs that unknown file formats are encountered. There are free tools to handle these (eg. try to guess the bit depth, X and Y resolution, etc) but currently not possible from within Slicer.

## Objective

1. Create the basics of such (likely simple) tool in Python.

## Approach and Plan

1. Design a basic GUI.
2. Add basic functionality.
3. Add ideas so they can be implemented later.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->

# Illustrations

<!--Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.-->
