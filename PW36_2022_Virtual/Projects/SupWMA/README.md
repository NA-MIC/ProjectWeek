# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

We propose a deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA) (Xue et al 2022, ISBI), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. We perform evaluation on a large tractography dataset with ground truth labels and on three independently acquired testing datasets from individuals across ages and health conditions.
In this project week, we work on releasing the code of SupWMA. We provide the trained model and testing samples for demonstration.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Code cleaning
2. Release code and pre-trained model
3. Documentation and testing samples

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Release code and pre-trained model at: https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/SupWMA
2. Provide the instruction of SupWMA framework usage
3. Upload the testing sample and demonstration script. 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Code and pre-trained model were released
2. Instruction, testing sample and demonstration script were provided
3. Update the trained details to help user train SupWMA on custom data. 
4. Intergate SupWMA into SlicerDMRI so that users can use it via Slicer interface.
