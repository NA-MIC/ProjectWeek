# Project Description

We propose a novel approach that reformulates anatomical landmark detection as a classification problem through a virtual agent placed
inside a 3D Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. This agent is trained to
navigate in a multi-scale volumetric space to reach the estimated landmark position. The
agent movements decision relies on a combination of Densely Connected Convolutional
Networks (DCCN) and fully connected layers. Our method achieved high accuracy with an average of
less than a 1.3mm error on the landmarks position without failures.
