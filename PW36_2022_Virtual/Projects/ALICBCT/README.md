# Project Description

We propose a novel approach that reformulates anatomical landmark detection as a classification problem through a virtual agent placed
inside a 3D Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. This agent is trained to
navigate in a multi-scale volumetric space to reach the estimated landmark position. The
agent movements decision relies on a combination of Densely Connected Convolutional
Networks (DCCN) and fully connected layers. Our method achieved high accuracy with an average of
less than a 1.3mm error on the landmarks position without failures.


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

The goal is to have a model that automatically finds accurate landmarks in CBCT scans.



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
A virtual agent is placed inside a 3D CBCT scan. This agent is trained to
navigate in a multi-scale volumetric space to reach the estimated landmark position. The decision making is processed through a deep neural network.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

Done :
1. Prepare the data to be used for training and prediction
2. Train the model with a set of 6 landmarks and 60 CBCTs
3. Test the accuracy of the prediction on new scans

Next:
1. Train the model on new landmarks and new CBCTs set
2. Create a slicer module that can be used to predict the landmark on various types of file
3. Optimize the training method to make it accessible for clinicians to train on their own dataset

# Project week results

During this project week I learned the basics on how to develop a slicer module.
I spent this week on creating a first sketch of a future module that will be used to launch the landmark prediction.
For now, it allows the user to browse folders where the AI models are located and create a menu where the clinician can choose which landmark to predict.
Our prediction method can be trained with any type of 3D images. This module must be user friendly and flexible so any clinician can easealy train and predict new landmarks.
