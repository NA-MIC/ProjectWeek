# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Intra-arterial chemotherapy requires knowing the position of the catheter tip in the body in order to insert the catheter accurately. Currently, the position is confirmed by X-ray irradiation during the operation. To reduce exposure and contrast agents, it is necessary to apply a new method to track the catheter tip. Electromagnetic tracking system with a TMR (Tunnel Magnetoresistance) sensor is helpful to track the catheter movement. Here, we developed an extension of 3D Slicer to connect 3D Slicer and our TMR tracking system.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Create an extension that can show catheter path from an electromagnetic tracking with TMR sensors in real time.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

A vessel model will be reconstructed from a preoperative 3D CT. During the operation, real-time data from the sensor is imported into 3D Slicer via OpenIGTLink. A first version is already done.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Connect TMR position tracker system to our extension via OpenIGTLink.
2. Testing.
