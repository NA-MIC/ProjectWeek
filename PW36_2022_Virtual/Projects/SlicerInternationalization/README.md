# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The goal of the project is to increase access to 3D Slicer in non-English speaking countries to foster global community engagement. The project is funded through an Essential Open Source Software for Science grant of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

To identify members of the Slicer community interested in contributing translations in their native language.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. Extraction of Qt strings from Slicer
3. Daily translation hackathons with members of the Slicer community from Senegal, Mauritania, Hungary, Ukraine, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, USA and France


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. New translators for Hungarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, German and Polish
2. Translation of the user interface of the Volumes module into seven different languages in SlicerCrowdin
3. Implementation of the Language selector in Slicer
