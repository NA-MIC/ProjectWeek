# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

In this project, we will include brain tissue segmentation maps into the existing unscented Kalman filter (UKF) framework (Malcolm et al 2010, IEEE TMI; Reddy et al 2016, Front. Neuroscience) to inform fiber tracking seeding and stopping. Segmentations of WM, GM and CSF are computed using a deep learning based method that performs tissue segmentation using diffusion MRI data (Zhang et al 2021, Neuroimage). The WM segmentation will be used for tractography seeding, and the GM/CSF segmentations will be used for tractography stopping.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Add WM/GM/CSF segmentation maps.
1. Add seeding and stopping masks.
1. Improve input check to handle multiple input options.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. UI design for better usage of the seeding/stopping options
1. CLI help documention

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Coding part of the project is almost done.
1. Push requst to the master branch of [UKF](https://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography/pull/142)
1. Waiting for the final pull requst approval
1. Decide default (suggested) settings for each option
1. Testing on more datasets other than HCP data.
