# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The Chest Imaging Platform (CIP) is an extension to 3D Slicer.

It integrates:
- chest image processing functionality as a toolkit by exposing the CLIs
- Slicer specific modules to provide user-friendly chest CT quantitative solutions
- Visualization of scale-space particles and labelmaps
- Integrated workflows to end-to-end clinical evaluation

In the current preview versions of 3D Slicer (4.13.0) parts of CIP fail to load the following CIP modules because Slicer's "Editor" module has been removed.

CIP_CalciumScoring

CIP_RVLVRatio

CIP_LesionModel

CIP_Calibration

CIP_MIPViewer

CIP_BodyComposition

CIP_ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling

CIP_ParenchymaAnalysis

CIP_PAARatio

CIP_AVRatio

CIP_InteractiveLobeSegmentation

The CIP extension currently uses legacy editor module, and charts infrastructure (instead of Segment editor, Plots, and Tables modules).

## Objective

- Replace the usage of the "Editor" module in CIP by something different, preferably the SegmentEditor.
- Replace labelmaps with segmentations
- Replace outdated fiducial calls (exceptions)
- Replace the charts infrastructure


## Approach and Plan

A fork and branch of SlicerCIP was created at https://github.com/rbumm/SlicerCIP/tree/Branch_CIPCompatSlicer5 to be used as the source base, all changes will later be included in a PR to https://github.com/acil-bwh/SlicerCIP.

Resolve compatibility problems step by step

Deactivate non-working or outdated modules in Slicer 5

## Considerations

## Progress and Next Steps

01/06/22:

Removing the "Editor" related imports from "Scripted/CIP_/CIP/ui/__init__.py" results in a complete CIP-startup in Slicer 4.13.0 without initial error messages.

A github search revealed that "Editor" calls are being made from three of the above modules:

- CIP_Calibration
- CIP_ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling
- CIP_BodyComposition

01/11/22:

- CIP_Calibration is probably outdated.
- CIP_ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling is outdated, probably redundant.
- CIP_BodyComposition is needed, but probably much better realized with AI segmentation

01/17/22: 12pm Meeting with Raul, Andras, Steve and Rudolf (Discord Red Slice)

- Incompabilities between 4.13 and CIP seem to be caused by CIPLibrary
- CIP, it's CLI functions and their history were demonstrated by @Raul
- CIP_Calibration is not outdated.
- CIP_ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling should be kept.
- CIP_BodyComposition is needed and should be kept
- CIP Toolkit functions should be included in a future SlicerCIP release
- A CIPLibrary compatibility branch "4.13" or "5.0" will be created
- CIP GitHub write access was requested for @Andras to support merging, @Raul agreed
- As labelmaps are used throughout CIP in nearly every module we will discuss a Slicer-based solution for that problem tomorrow

01/18/22: 12pm Meeting with Raul, Andras, Rudolf (Discord Red Slice)

- good follow up meeting
- @rbumm demonstrated the build process
- a first module (Calibration) has been adapted to 4.13 and now works with the Segment Editor instead of Editor
- ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling was demonstrated by Raul
- we decided to prioritize certain modules during CIP adaptation
- ParenchymaAnalysis probably the next to go
- Andras promised to look into CLI modules and letting them use segmentations instead of labelmaps as an input maybe automatically
- next meeting will be Thursday 11 am Red Slice

# Final presentation start here

01/20/22: 11am-12:30pm Meeting with Raul, Andras, Rudolf (Discord Red Slice)

- The Chest Imaging Platform extension's "Calibrate" module has been finalized for Slicer 5 together with @lassoan and was demonstrated by @rbumm
-  see this [SlicerCIP GitHub fork](https://github.com/rbumm/SlicerCIP/tree/Branch_CIPCompatSlicer5) and [this commit](https://github.com/rbumm/SlicerCIP/commit/86c8173639a2ecc3c08993fa311625bec51378c9)
- will serve  as a skeleton to adopt the other CIP modules and is now fully functional
- The "Calibration" widget uses a newly created segmentation for each volume instead of labelmaps
- the segmentation can be edited in the embedded Segment Editor
- before pressing "Calibrate" the segmentation is converted to a labelmap for the actual calibration in the logic()
- in addition, we developed a strategy on how to transform the other CIP modules to Slicer 5
- non-working modules will be excluded from CMake to provide only those functional to the community
- @Raul demonstrated new vessel segmentation techniques and answered many questions
- @Raul agreed on giving @lassoan write access to the SlicerCIP GitHub repository
