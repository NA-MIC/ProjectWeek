# Project Description
Integration of Flir Thermal Camera in Slicer in order to capture and process images

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Learning Slicer
1. Objective B. Integration of Flir Thermal Camera in Slicer
1. Objective C. Capture and process the images

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Communicating with the experts of this field who have participated in this PW for getting information of the best way of getting start
1. Communicating with the experts if they can facilitate us some Links of the tutorials and Slicer documentation
1. Study the SDK of the thermal Camera Flir in order to find the Python library and the instruction of connecting the camera with the embedded Python of Slicer
1. Studding the documentation of Slicer for learning the way of using the functions of the Slicer extensions into de python

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. We have developed the interface class for the Flir thermal Camera with all necessary functions for connecting and capturing the images 
1. We import the mentioned interface class into de Python of Slicer and we were able to capture images by simulating the camera
1. We started to acquaint with the extensions of Slicer 
1. We will try to learn more about the abilities of Slicer extensions in order to apply them in Python
