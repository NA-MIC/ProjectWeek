# Project Description

Augmented Reality has increased its adoption in many areas with exciting benefits. Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Madrid, Spain) has already worked in several medical projects
based on AR (see their progress in https://biig-igt.uc3m.es/augmented-reality/). On these studies, they usually export information from Slicer to an alternative software (Unity).

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new 3D Slicer module that will allow to use augmented reality directly in 3D Slicer. With it, it will be possible
to centralize the working process, at the time of benefiting from all Slicer tools.

Ebatinca S.L. in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), has already started this project in collaboration with Kitware (France) and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain) and
they all are currently developing OpenXR.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Create OpenXR, a code based on the currently existing OpenVR so that the new mixed reality version is compatible with VTK.

2. [Slicer Documentation on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality support](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs/Augmented_Reality_and_Virtual_Reality_support#Current_approaches)

## Approach and Plan

1. Develop a new Slicer extension that streams AR directly to HoloLens 2.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. OpenXR in VTK:

The WIP branch supporting Holographic remoting to stream VTK rendering inside the Hololens has been submitted [here](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/merge_requests/8101).

2. Our [github](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/5978) latest upload
3. We confirmed the prototype developed by Lucas Gandel by streaming VTK to the HoloLens 2 via Holographic Remoting.
