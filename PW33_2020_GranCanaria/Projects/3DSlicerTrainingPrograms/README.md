# Project Description

In this edition of the training project, new professionals will work in order to develop new training material and study how to enhance and improve the use of 3DSlicer as a training tool. We intend to create new training tools as new atlases and study its use in the African countries of Senegal and Mauritania. It will also be included the proposal of a training program for Universities in Morocco and other projects that could arise.

## Objective

1. To discuss and plan the introduccion of 3D Slicer training material in the universities of the new African countries.
1. To study the impact of previous training programs.

## Approach and Plan

1. 3D Slicer introduction.
1. Discussion of experiences in other African universities.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Initial training have been delivered for the African collaborators, including newcomers from Morocco
1. In these training sessions the African collaborators experienced have been advised
1. Information to draft the introduction of the development of 3D Slicer modules for engineers
1. The creation of multidisciplinary workgroups, with medicine and engineer degree students have been planned
1. A new way to deliver the educative content for these groups has been planned
