# Project Description

This project is the follow-up of the development of a module to use InfraRed (IR) sensors in 3D Slicer for medical diagnosis, intended to use for monitoring of foot ulcers in diabetic patients, presented on the 28thPW NA-MIC. This project is proposed as a new stage in the diabetic foot assessment previously worked.

The aim is to integrate an algorithm, which is based on Deep Learning, for foot segmentation using multimodal images (visible and depth-map images). The resulting mask will be applied on thermal images in order to analyze the temperature pattern and detect possible foot ulcers.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Update the "Diabetic Foot" extension created on the 28thPW NA-MIC.
1. Integrate the foot segmentation algorithm presented on the paper [1].
