# Project Description

Whitematteranalysis is a python pipeline for peforming fibre processing and clustering. The project aims to upgrade this package,
porting it to python3, adding a comprehensive suite of regression tests and porting it into 3D Slicer. This will make the pipeline
easier to use, maintain and extend, all of white are beneficial for applicaple dMRI workflows.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Port the codebase to python3, adding regression tests to ensure consistancy.
1. Objective B. Bundle the pipleine into 3D Slicer, adding a qt based GUI as an alternative to the CLI interface
1. Objective C. Add regression tests for existing and added functionality.

## Approach and Plan

1. Testing and iterate the python version conversion
1. Explore options for running python externally to 3D slicer to allow the porting of required dependenceis.
1. Document functionality to ensure coverage for the testing suite
