# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
We aiming at developing an affordable ultrasound navigation system for breast biopsy training, following the philosophy of the systems for vascular insertion presented in previous Project Weeks. The system comprises the construction of the breast phantom —including the tumor—, the position tracking of medical instruments —ultrasound probe and biopsy needle—, and the calculation of basic metrics to evaluate the efficiency in training exercise performance.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Construct an ultrasound phantom for training breast biopsy
1. Set up the OptiTrack V120:Duo system to track the ultrasound probe and the biopsy needle
1. Analyze registered tacking data and compute performance metrics.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. Test and select materials in order to mimic breast tumors echogenicity
1. Build the breast phantom with tumors
1. Configure the OptiTrack V120:Duo tracking system and the corresponding device available in the PLUS to send the position data to 3D Slicer
1. Customize the interface to this particular procedure (breast biopsy)
1. Define some simple metrics to evaluate training performance and implement the algorithms to compute them in a manner similar to the one proposed in the Perk Tutor.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
