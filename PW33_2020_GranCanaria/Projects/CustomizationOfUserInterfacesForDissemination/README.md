# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
This project aims at creating a minimal user interface oriented to museological environments. A 3D Slicer application will be implemented with the basic functionality and then its graphic user interface will be customized to a prescribed design. In addition, alternative input/output devices will be considered instead of the usual ones (keyboard, mouse and monitor). Therefore, we will work on the integration of hardware devices such as push buttons, a trackball, a gesture tracking device (Leap Motion), and a touch screen via serial communications. It is also intended to provide the system with 3D visualization capabilities using the SlicerVirtualReality extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Define a methodology to customize the graphical user interface of applications based on 3D Slicer
1. Combine 3D Slicer and PLUS facilities to integrate new input/output devices
1. Include 3D visualization capabilities.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. Design a simple graphical user interface suitable for museological interfaces
1. Implement the prescribed interface using a Python scripted module
1. Integrate push buttons and a trackball connected to an Arduino-like platform in 3D Slicer using PLUS
1. Use SlicerVirtualReality extension to include visualization in virtual reality glasses
1. Integrate the Leap Motion.
