# Project Description

In this project, we will explore the possibility of communicating a proprietary NIRS equipment under development with 3D Slicer through OpenIGTLink protocol. Our team is currently developing a NIRS device that can be currently controlled and interrogated from 3DSlicer through commands implemented over TCP/IP protocol. We aim to include the ability in the NIRS device to interact with 3DSlicer through the standard OpenIGTLink protocol. To achieve this goal in this week, we propose to study what modifications of the device software are necessary to implement a minimum of interoperability between 3DSlicer and the NIRS device through OpenIGTLink.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.	Implementing minimum set of commands to control and retrieve information from NIR device through OpenIGTLink protocol / 3DSlicer.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.	Discuss the convenience of making our NIRS device OpenIGTLink-compliant.  
2.	Select minimum set of queries/messages to implement.
3.	Implement a simple 3DSlicer module showing control/interaction with NIRS device.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
