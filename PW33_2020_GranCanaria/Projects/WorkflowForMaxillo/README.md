# Adapt an already existing workflow in maxillofacial reconstructive surgery to Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Attila Nagy  (University of Szeged)
- Andras Lasso (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics Inc.)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Adapt an already existing workflow to Slicer. Currently it inolves MeshMixer and Blender - which is great but a little too much...

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.Take a look at the current way of doing it and see what (likely not too big ) adjustments need to be done to be able to achieve the same results from within Slicer.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Consult with experts in the field and possibly develop modules.
1. Try to "re-do" the same workflow from within Slicer


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Successfully recreated the workflow
1. Began to work on an small module that will expose the script from the Slicer script repository to the GUI
