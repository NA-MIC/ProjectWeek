# Project Description

1.  The objective of this project is to review white matter.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Our goal is to study diffusion MRI of healthy people and those with schizophrenia to identify white matter tracts that are involved in social cognition and/or emotional awareness.

## Approach and Plan
<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. The Levels of emotional awareness scale (LEAS) is used to assess social cognition. It has two parts: LEAS-self and LEAS-other, which are used to assess the ability to identify our own feeling and those of others, respectively.

1. Previously we have shown correlations between gray matter and the LEAS score.

1. We will refine our hypothesis of the white matter connecting the gray matter regions of interest.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

We held discussions and refined our hypothesis of which white matter tracts to focus on in our study.

Next steps are to run correlations on data from ~20 people with schizophrenia and matched controls.
