# Extensions Manager Refresh

## Key Investigators

- Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin (Kitware)
- Andras Lasso (Queen's University)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics)

# Project Description

The current infrastructure is on ["life-support"](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs/ExtensionsServer#status), during the past two years, Kitware has been working toward phasing out the aging Midas based server used to host, serve and manage Slicer application and extension packages.

Kitware now has a Girder plugin for the backend (meaning API endpoints and database interaction). See https://slicer-package-manager.readthedocs.io. We also experimented with few prototype regarding the extension manager but have nothing production ready.

The goal of this project is to prototype on updated frontend.
