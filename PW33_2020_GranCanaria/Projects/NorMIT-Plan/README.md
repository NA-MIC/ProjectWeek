# NorMIT-Plan

## Key Investigators

- Rafael Palomar (The Intervention Centre, Oslo University Hospital
  and NTNU).

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

NorMIT-Plan is part of the **Nor**wegian centre for **M**inimally
**I**nvasive Guided **T**hrerapy (NorMIT). The centre offers resources
for medical technology research in minimally invasive
therapies. NorMIT-Plan is a software package developed as a set of 3D Slicer
modules which will provide tools for segmentation, 3D modeling and
surgical plannig for liver resection procedures.

In this project we will update the software to the latest 3D Slicer
version, fix known bugs and create a 3D Slicer extension.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objeoctive A. Update modules to work on the latest Slicer.
2. Objective B. Fix known bugs.
3. Objective C. Create 3D Slicer extension.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Update modules to Qt5 and test against latest 3D Slicer released
2. Review and check of DisplayableManager for the planning module 
3. Create and register a 3D Slicer extension 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
