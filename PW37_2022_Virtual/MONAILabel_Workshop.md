* Connection info for access to your cloud 3D Slicer instance will be emailed to you before/during the workshop and you'll get instructions on how to connect. 
   * The AWS team has worked to provide you with a server in your geographic location, but if you experience latency it may be possible to assign you to a different region for better performance.
   * Your cloud instance will be available from the time you receive the email.  It may take a minute or two to start when you first connect.
   * It will remain active for about 1 hour after the workshop ends if you want to work on it more.

*Big thanks in advance to the AWS, NVIDIA and Slicer teams for providing this activity!*
