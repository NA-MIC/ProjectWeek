# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Given two groups of shapes, represented as binary volumes, the Poisson shape analysis algorithm extracts the region of statistically difference on the shape.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Add the Poisson shape analysis module as an extension to Slicer.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Make the ctkPathLineEdit able to select multiple file names.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Currently the CLI can run from the command line and read multiple files. But from Slicer GUI, since the ctkPathLineEdit can only open a single file, it can't read multiple shape files for analysis.

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository. If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
