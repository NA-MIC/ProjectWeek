# Project Description

SlicerVR is a nice tool for visualization of medical 3D data. It can be used in preoperative planning, surgical training and others. However, understanding how to interact with the images and models or getting used to move around the Slicer scene using the VR controllers can be difficult at the beginning. Therefore, a first steps tutorial could be useful for new users.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a SlicerVR tutorial module to learn the basic actions needed to interact with objects and move around the 3D scene.


## Approach and Plan

1. Define the actions to train (fly, grab, transform scene...)
1. Decide how to train those actions (define target positions or actions)
1. Decide the tutorial workflow (how to change which action is being trained)
1. Implement the module.
1. Test with different headsets (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift...)
