# Project Description

Add a new feature to Slicer to describe/edit/interact with rotation transforms

## Objective

Getting the correct angular descriptions of transforms to sliders, and from sliders back to a matrix, indenpendently of the order of the sliders change

## Approach and Plan

There is a rudimental implementation here:

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Confirm the math needed for the transforms, implement some tests on python.
