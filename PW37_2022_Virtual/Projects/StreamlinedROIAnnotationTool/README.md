# Project Description

Fast and efficient means of loading mammogram's from server into a web based 
viewer. Viewer is equipped with an ROI tool for generating bounding boxes (BB)
as simply as possible. It will allow users to create the BB, as well as 
give it a score of likelihood that region is indeed cancer. Then, with the 
press of a button, the roi and image id along with user info are saved back to 
the server for later use. After being saved a new mammogram will then be served 
up from the server into the viewer for them to again annotate. The saved 
annotations from professionals will then be used later on in our research for 
comparing classifier generated ROIs against professionally labeled ones.

## Objective

This tool is a subset of a much larger project, Oregon-Massachusetts Mammography
Database (OMAMA-DB), and has the sole purpose of giving professional labelers an 
efficient way to label a massive amount of mammograms as fast and as simply 
as possible.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Learn and understand how to use Cornerstone.js which is a key component 
   in making this tool possible. (done)
2. Use Tornado webserver for backend because of its ability to make 
   asynchronous web requests, which will allow for multiple annotators to be working 
   simultaneously with our data. (done)
3. Using Tornado and Cornerstone, build a simple and fast method to serve up 
   mammograms from our dataset on server. (done)
4. Add ROI functionality. (done)
5. Add scoring functionality.
6. Add a method for users to mark if an image is defective.
7. Add a method to clear Previously added ROIs
8. Add a simple way to save data back to server. (done)

## Progress

1. Have been able to use Cornerstone.js and Tornado webserver to load 
   mammograms from server into the web based viewer.
2. Have been able to add the ROI functionality to viewer.
3. Have added the ability to press either *enter* or *space* key to save ROI 
   and image information back to server.

## Next Steps
1. Need to add scoring functionality.
2. Need to add way to mark image as defective.
3. Need to add way to clear Previously added ROIs.
