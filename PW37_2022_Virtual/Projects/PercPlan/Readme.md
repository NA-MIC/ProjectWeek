# Percutaneous Planing

## Key Investigators

- Nirav Patel (IIT Madras, India)
# Project Description

Aim of this projhect is to craete a Slicer extension/module that would streamline the percutensous trajectory planning.
## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Streamline percutaneous planning interface by integrating some of the modules such as fiducial markers, models, tranform, volume reslice driver etc

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. We already have created a preliminary module and we would like to get feedback from the IGT community and see if this could be helpful for integration with the low-cost navigation system  NousNav

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
