# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
This is an extension for computing the percentage of colocalization(Spatial overlap between different channels) of Z-stack TIFF images.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. As of now, the computation of my module is a bit slow (generally each computation takes 1-2 minutes or more), so I'm hoping to get help from slicer experts to make it faster.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Collaborate with Slicer community members during this Project Week.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Currently my extension has already implemented the calculation functionality and the current goal is to increase the calculation speed.


# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.

-->
Users can threshold the volume rendering of the input Z-stack image in the 3D view window, select the region of interest(ROI) by the bounding box, and get a Venn diagram that shows the critical metric of colocalization's percentage.
