# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Virtual endoscopy extracts the lumen from volumetric images and creates a fly-through visualization similar to the real endoscopy examinations.

Slicer has an Endoscopy module, based on Delphine Nain's work:
https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/87240

The current Endoscopy module requires the already extracted surface as input. The proposed module, however, starts from volumetric data and can perform vessel segmentation etc.


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Add the VirtualEndoscopy to Slicer extension.
1. Objective B. Contribute the vessel segmentation as a Segmentation Effect.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. It's currently already on github. 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. The extension and the module has already been pushed to github
